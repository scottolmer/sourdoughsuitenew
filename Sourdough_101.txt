INTRODUCTION (5 minutes)
INTRODUCTION (5 minutes)
________________


[As students settle in]
Good [morning/afternoon], everyone! Welcome. I'm so glad you're here. My name is Scott, and I'm one of the chefs here at [Restaurant Name]. I've been working with sourdough for [X years], and I'm excited to share what we do here in our bakery with you today.
Before we dive in, let me tell you what you're getting yourself into over the next 90 minutes.
[Gesture to materials on table]
First, the good news: you're going home with some tools to get you started. Everyone will receive a live sourdough starter that's ready to use—this is the same starter we use here in the bakery. You'll also get a binder that has everything we're covering today: feeding schedules, recipes, troubleshooting guides, visual references, and some blank templates so you can plan your own bakes. Think of it as your sourdough roadmap.
[Set expectations]
Now, here's what we're NOT doing today: we're not baking bread. I know, I know—but here's why. Sourdough works on its own timeline, not ours. A full bake from start to finish could take 24 hours or more. Instead, what I'm going to show you today are the critical decision points in that process. We have doughs here at different stages—some mixed too much, some not enough, some ready to shape, some that sat too long. You're going to see what "right" looks like and what "wrong" looks like, so when you're standing in your kitchen at 10 PM wondering "is this done fermenting?"—you'll actually know.
[Build confidence]
By the end of today, you're going to understand three core things:
One: How to create, feed, and maintain a sourdough starter—and more importantly, how to tell when it's ready to actually use.
Two: How to recognize when your dough is properly mixed and when it's properly fermented. This is where most beginners struggle, and it's 100% visual and tactile. I'm going to show you exactly what to look for.
Three: How to build a baking schedule that works for YOUR life. Whether you want fresh bread on Saturday morning or you need to fit this around a work schedule, we'll map out how to make that happen.
[Preview the series]
This is the first class in a series we're developing. Today is fundamentals—starters, mixing, fermentation, timing. Future classes will dive deeper into shaping techniques, scoring, baking itself, and working with different types of dough. But you've got to walk before you run, right? Everything starts with understanding your starter and your dough.
[Set the tone]
One more thing: please ask questions as we go. There's no such thing as a stupid question in sourdough. This is living dough—it doesn't read recipes, it doesn't care what the internet says, and it's going to do slightly different things in your kitchen than it does in mine. The goal here is for you to understand the why behind what's happening, not just follow steps blindly.
[Transition]
Alright, let's get started. We're going to begin with the heart of everything: the sourdough starter itself.
________________


[Move into Part 1]


PART 1: STARTERS
PART 1: SOURDOUGH STARTERS (28 minutes)
________________


1A: What Is a Starter? (5 min)
[Hold up a jar of active starter]
So, what exactly is this stuff? At its most basic, a sourdough starter is just flour and water that's been colonized by wild yeast and bacteria. That's it. No magic, no secret ingredients—just flour, water, and time.
[Point to the starter]
But here's what makes it special: unlike the little packets of commercial yeast you buy at the store, a sourdough starter is a living ecosystem. You've got wild yeast in here doing the heavy lifting of making the dough rise, and you've got lactic acid bacteria—same family as what makes yogurt tangy—creating all that complex flavor and acidity.
When you use commercial yeast, you get bread that rises predictably and tastes... like bread. Fine, nothing wrong with that. But when you use a sourdough starter, you're getting fermentation that develops flavor over hours or even days. You get that characteristic tang, that deeper complexity, that chewy texture. You're tasting time.
[Practical point]
Now, your starter does two jobs in your dough. Job one: it's your leavener. The yeast produces carbon dioxide, which gets trapped in the gluten network and makes your bread rise. Job two: it's your flavor developer. Those bacteria are producing lactic acid and acetic acid—that's what gives sourdough its signature sour taste. The longer and slower your fermentation, the more flavor you build.
[Set up next section]
But here's the thing—and this is critical—your starter is only useful if it's active. A starter sitting in your fridge for three weeks? Not active. A starter you just fed ten minutes ago? Not active. A starter that's been sitting on your counter for three days? Probably dead.
So how do you know when it's ready to use? That's what we're about to look at.
________________


1B: Starter States - Visual Demonstrations (10 min)
[Bring out three jars of starter in different states, lined up on the table]
Alright, I've got three starters here, and they're all going to tell you a different story. Learning to read your starter is the single most important skill you'll develop, because if you use it at the wrong time, your bread will not work. Period.
[Pick up jar #1 - underfed/sluggish starter]
Starter #1: Underfed or Sluggish
Look at this one. What do you notice? It's kind of... flat, right? Maybe a few bubbles on top, but it's dense, it hasn't risen much since the last feeding.
[Open the jar, let them smell]
Smell it. Pass it around if you want—don't be shy. What do you smell? It's not that fresh, yeasty smell. It might smell a little sour, maybe a bit like acetone or nail polish remover. That's because the yeast is starving. It's eaten through all the available food, and now the bacteria are dominating.
[Demonstrate the float test]
Here's a quick test we can do: the float test. Take a small spoonful of starter, drop it in a glass of water. If it's active and full of gas, it should float.
[Drop a spoonful - it sinks]
See that? Straight to the bottom. This starter is not ready to bake with. It's not dead—I could feed it and bring it back to life—but right now, it doesn't have the strength to leaven your dough.
________________


[Pick up jar #2 - needs feeding]
Starter #2: Needs Feeding
Now look at this one. You might see this in your kitchen if you keep your starter in the fridge and pull it out after a few days.
[Point to the liquid on top]
See this liquid pooling on top? That's called hooch. It's mostly alcohol—a byproduct of fermentation. When you see hooch, your starter is telling you: "Hey, I'm hungry. I've eaten all my food and now I'm basically fermenting my own waste products."
You can pour it off or stir it back in—totally up to you. Stirring it back in will make your starter a little more sour. Pouring it off keeps it milder. Either way, this starter needs to be fed before you use it.
[Timing note]
If you keep your starter in the fridge, this is totally normal. You'll probably see hooch after 5-7 days. That's fine. Just means it's time for a feeding. If you're keeping it at room temperature and you see hooch after 12 hours? You need to feed it more often or use a different ratio.
________________


[Pick up jar #3 - active, ready to bake]
Starter #3: Active and Ready to Bake
Now THIS is what you're looking for.
[Hold it up to eye level]
Look at the dome. It's risen—maybe doubled in size since I fed it. The surface is bubbly, it's got this really active, alive look to it. When I open this...
[Open the jar]
...it smells fresh. Yeasty. A little tangy, but not harsh. It smells like something you'd want to eat.
[Float test demonstration]
Let's try the float test on this one.
[Drop a spoonful in water - it floats]
Boom. Floats immediately. That means it's full of carbon dioxide, it's active, it's ready to work.
[Timing discussion]
Here's the thing about timing: this starter was fed about 4-6 hours ago, depending on the temperature in the room. In the summer, it might peak in 3-4 hours. In the winter, might take 8. You're not watching the clock—you're watching the starter.
[Visual cues summary]
So when you're at home, here's what you're looking for:
* Has it doubled? Or close to it?
* Is the top domed, not flat or collapsed?
* Does it smell fresh and yeasty?
* Does it pass the float test?
If yes to all of those, you're good to go. Use it right at that peak, or within an hour or two after.
[What happens if you wait too long]
If you wait too long—if it rises, peaks, and then starts to collapse back down—you've missed the window. The yeast has eaten all the food and it's starting to weaken. You can still use it, but your dough might be sluggish. Better to feed it again and wait for the next peak.
[Pass the starters around]
Go ahead and pass these around. Look at them, smell them, get familiar with what these different stages look like. This is the knowledge that's going to save you hours of frustration at home.
________________


1C: Maintenance Schedule (8 min)
[Transition]
Alright, so you can recognize an active starter. Now let's talk about how to keep it that way. Because your starter is alive, and like anything alive, it needs food and care.
[Feeding ratios]
When we talk about feeding a starter, we're talking about ratios. The most common ratio you'll see is 1:1:1. That means one part starter, one part flour, one part water by weight.
So if you've got 50 grams of starter in your jar, you add 50 grams of flour and 50 grams of water. Mix it up, and now you've got 150 grams of starter total. Simple.
[Why ratios matter]
But you might also see 1:5:5, or 1:2:2, or other ratios. What's that about? It's about how fast you want it to ferment. A 1:1:1 feeding? That starter will peak quickly—maybe 4-6 hours. A 1:5:5 feeding? You're giving it way more food, so it takes longer to eat through it all—maybe 8-12 hours or even longer.
Why would you want that? Maybe you're going to bed and you want it to peak right when you wake up. Or maybe you're going away for the weekend and you want to slow everything down. The ratio is your control knob.
[Room temperature vs. refrigerated]
Here's your big decision: room temperature or refrigerator?
Room temperature: Your starter is active and hungry. You're feeding it once or twice a day, every day. This is great if you're baking multiple times a week. It's ready to use whenever you need it.
Refrigerator: Your starter goes into hibernation mode. Fermentation slows way down. You can feed it once a week, maybe even less. This is the way to go if you're baking occasionally—once a week, once every two weeks, whatever.
[Practical advice for beginners]
For most of you starting out, I'd recommend the fridge method. Feed your starter, let it sit at room temperature for an hour or two to get going, then stick it in the fridge. When you want to bake, pull it out the night before, feed it, and let it come to room temperature and peak. Easy.
[Common questions]
"Is my starter dead?"
Probably not. Unless it's growing mold or smells like something died in it, your starter is almost definitely salvageable. Even if it's been in the fridge for a month and looks terrible—feed it, give it 24-48 hours and a couple of feedings, and it'll probably bounce back.
Starters are resilient. They want to live. You'd have to really neglect one to kill it.
[Point to binder]
In your binder, you've got a full feeding schedule chart with different scenarios—daily feeding, weekly feeding, getting ready for a bake, troubleshooting weak starters. Use that as your reference.
________________


1D: Using Starter in Recipes (5 min)
[Transition]
Okay, last piece of the starter puzzle: actually using it in a recipe.
[Timing]
First: when do you add it to your dough? Right at peak activity, or just after. If you add it too early—when it's only been fed for an hour or two—it's not strong enough yet. If you wait too long and it's collapsed, same problem. You want that sweet spot we talked about earlier: doubled, domed, bubbly, passes the float test.
[Hydration matters]
Second thing: hydration. Most starters are kept at 100% hydration. That means equal parts flour and water by weight. So if you have 100 grams of starter, it's 50 grams flour and 50 grams water.
Why does this matter? Because when you add starter to your dough, you're adding both flour AND water. The recipe accounts for that, but you need to know what hydration your starter is at. If a recipe assumes 100% and yours is at 80%? Your dough's going to be off.
[Keep it simple for beginners]
My advice: stick with 100% hydration. That's what most recipes assume, and it makes the math easy. Down the road, you can experiment with stiffer or looser starters, but for now, keep it simple.
[Baker's percentages - quick mention]
You'll see in your binder there's a page on baker's percentages. That's just the language bakers use to write recipes—everything is calculated as a percentage of the total flour weight. Don't worry about mastering that today. Just know it exists, and when you're reading recipes, you'll start to see those numbers.
[Transition to next section]
Alright, so now you know your starter, you know how to feed it, you know when it's ready. Next question: what do you DO with it? You mix it into dough. And that's where we're headed next—understanding how flour and water turn into actual dough structure.
Any questions on starters before we move on?
[Take 1-2 quick questions, then transition]
Great. Let's talk about gluten.


PART 2: FLOUR & GLUTEN DEVELOPMENT
PART 2: FLOUR & GLUTEN DEVELOPMENT (23 minutes)
________________


2A: Understanding Gluten & Flour Basics (8 min)
[Start with flour - have a few bags/containers visible]
Before we talk about gluten, we need to talk about flour. Because not all flour is created equal, and this is where a lot of beginners run into trouble.
[Pick up bread flour]
Flour Types - Quick Hit
This is bread flour. High protein content—usually around 12-13%. That protein is what forms gluten. More protein means more gluten potential, which means stronger dough structure. This is what you want for sourdough.
[Pick up all-purpose flour]
This is all-purpose flour. It's got less protein—usually around 10-11%. It'll still work for sourdough, but your dough won't have quite as much strength or spring. It's softer, which is great for biscuits or pancakes, but it's not ideal for a high-hydration sourdough loaf that needs to hold its shape.
[Quick practical advice]
Here's my advice: when you're starting out, use bread flour. Follow recipes that call for bread flour. Once you understand how dough should feel and behave, then you can start experimenting with AP flour or mixing in whole grains.
Speaking of whole grains—
[Mention whole wheat if you have it]
Whole wheat flour, rye, spelt, all of those absorb more water than white flour. They also ferment faster because there's more food for the yeast to eat. If a recipe calls for 20% whole wheat and you decide to use 50%, your dough is going to behave totally differently. Just something to be aware of.
[Check binder reference]
There's a flour guide in your binder on page [X] that breaks down the different types, protein contents, and when to use what. But for today, just remember: bread flour for sourdough. Simple.
________________


[Transition to gluten]
Alright, now let's talk about why protein content matters. It all comes down to gluten.
[What is gluten?]
Gluten is a network of proteins—mainly glutenin and gliadin—that forms when you mix flour and water together and then work that dough. Think of it like a net or a web. That web is what traps the gas produced by your yeast, which is what makes your bread rise and gives it structure.
[Demonstrate with hands - miming]
When you first mix flour and water, you've got loose proteins just floating around. But as you knead, fold, or stretch the dough, those proteins start linking up with each other. They form longer and longer chains, and those chains start tangling and cross-linking. That's gluten development.
No gluten development? Your dough is just a shaggy mess that won't hold gas. Full gluten development? You've got a strong, elastic dough that can trap all that CO2 and give you a tall, airy loaf.
[Mixing vs. developing]
Here's an important distinction: mixing and developing are not the same thing.
Mixing is just combining your ingredients—starter, flour, water, salt—until there's no dry flour left. That takes a minute or two. You're just getting everything incorporated.
Developing is the process of building that gluten network. That takes time and mechanical action—kneading, folding, stretching. Depending on your method, that could take 10 minutes of active work, or it could happen slowly over several hours with periodic folds.
[Why this matters]
Why do we care about gluten development? Two reasons.
One: structure. If your gluten isn't developed enough, your dough can't hold its shape. It'll spread out like a pancake instead of rising up.
Two: oven spring. That's the final burst of rise you get in the oven. If your gluten network is weak, the gas just escapes instead of pushing your dough upward.
So when I show you these dough samples in a minute, you're going to see exactly what different levels of gluten development look like and how to test for it.
________________


2B: Gluten Development Stages - Demonstration (15 min)
[Bring out 3 dough samples, clearly labeled]
Alright, here we go. I've got three doughs here that are all the same recipe, same hydration, but they've been mixed for different amounts of time. What you're about to see is the progression from "not even close" to "ready to go."
[Pick up sample #1 - undermixed]
Sample 1: Undermixed Dough
Look at this one.
[Hold it up, let them see it]
What do you notice? It's shaggy, right? It's rough. If I pull on it—
[Gently pull at the dough]
—it tears immediately. There's no elasticity. The ingredients are combined, but the gluten hasn't formed yet. This is what your dough looks like right after you've mixed everything together and maybe given it a few kneads.
[The windowpane test]
Now I'm going to show you the windowpane test. This is THE test for gluten development. You take a small piece of dough and you gently stretch it between your fingers, trying to make it thin enough that light can pass through it—like a windowpane.
[Demonstrate - it tears]
See that? I can barely stretch it at all before it rips. No windowpane. This dough has almost no gluten development.
[What happens if you bake this]
If you tried to bake this dough right now—assuming you fermented it and everything—you'd get a dense, flat loaf. The gluten network isn't there to trap gas, so all that CO2 your yeast is producing would just escape. You'd end up with something closer to a hockey puck than a loaf of bread.
[Pass it around]
Go ahead and pass this around. Touch it. Pull on it gently. Get a feel for what undermixed dough feels like.
________________


[Pick up sample #2 - partial development]
Sample 2: Partial Development
Now look at this one. Already looks different, right?
[Show the surface]
The surface is smoother. It's starting to come together. If I pull on it—
[Stretch it gently]
—it stretches a bit before it tears. There's some elasticity now. The gluten network is forming, but it's not complete yet.
[Windowpane test]
Let's try the windowpane test.
[Demonstrate - it stretches thin but tears before translucent]
Okay, so I can stretch it thinner than the first sample, but it still tears before I get to that translucent membrane. We're getting there, but we're not done.
[When this stage is acceptable]
Now here's the thing: for some types of bread, this level of development is actually fine. If you're making a rustic, craggy loaf with a very open crumb and you're using a high hydration dough, you might stop here and let time and fermentation do the rest of the work.
But for most beginner bakers, especially if you're doing a straightforward country loaf, you want to keep going until you hit full development. It's just easier and more forgiving.
[Pass it around]
Pass this one around too. Notice how it feels different from the first sample—smoother, more cohesive, but still a bit rough in spots.
________________


[Pick up sample #3 - full development]
Sample 3: Full Development
And this is what we're aiming for.
[Hold it up]
Look at the surface. It's completely smooth. It's got a slight sheen to it. If I poke it—
[Poke the dough]
—it springs back. There's tension in the dough. It feels alive. That's the gluten network fully formed.
[Stretch it]
If I pull on it gently, it stretches easily without tearing. It's elastic but also strong.
[Windowpane test - the moment of truth]
And now, the windowpane test.
[Carefully stretch a small piece between your fingers, creating a thin translucent membrane]
There it is. You see that? I can stretch this dough so thin that light passes through it, and it's not tearing. That's a fully developed gluten network. That web of proteins we talked about earlier? It's complete. This dough is ready to trap gas, hold its shape, and give you oven spring.
[Other signs of full development]
Here are the other things you're looking for:
Surface tension: When I shape this dough, I can feel it tighten up. It wants to hold its shape.
Bounce-back: If I poke it, it springs back. That's elasticity.
Smooth appearance: No rough patches, no tears, just a cohesive, smooth skin.
This is the feel you're chasing at home. And honestly, the windowpane test is your best friend. It takes the guesswork out. If you can make a windowpane, you're good to go.
[Pass it around]
Pass this around. This is what properly developed dough feels like. Get your hands on it. Stretch a small piece yourself. This is the tactile knowledge that's going to make you successful.
________________


[Quick note on over-mixing]
Now, I'm not going to show you an over-mixed dough today because honestly, it's pretty rare if you're mixing by hand at home. You'd have to really go after it for a long time. Over-mixed dough gets sticky, it loses structure, it feels broken down. If you ever get there, you'll know—but most beginners never have that problem. The problem is usually not mixing enough.
________________


[Transition to mixing methods]
Mixing Methods for Home Bakers
Alright, so how do you actually develop gluten at home? You've got a few options.
[Option 1: Hand kneading]
Traditional kneading. Push the dough away from you with the heels of your hands, fold it back over itself, rotate, repeat. This works, but it's a workout, especially with high-hydration doughs. You're looking at 10-15 minutes of continuous kneading to hit full development.
[Option 2: Stretch and fold]
Stretch and fold. This is my favorite method for beginners. You let time do most of the work. Every 30 minutes during the first part of your bulk fermentation, you grab one side of the dough, stretch it up, fold it over itself. Rotate the bowl, repeat on all four sides. That's one set. You do this 3-4 times over a couple hours, and by the end, your gluten is fully developed without you having to knead at all. Gentle, effective, and way easier on your hands.
[Option 3: Slap and fold]
Slap and fold, also called French kneading. You pick the dough up, slap it down on the counter, fold it over itself. It's fast—you can develop gluten in 5-8 minutes this way—but it's messy and takes some practice. It's a great technique, but maybe not for your first few loaves.
[Option 4: Coil folds]
Coil folds. Similar to stretch and fold but even gentler. You slide your hands under the dough, lift it up from the center, and let the ends fold under themselves. Rotate 90 degrees, repeat. This is great for really wet doughs that are hard to handle.
[Check binder reference]
There are step-by-step photos and descriptions of all these techniques in your binder on page [X]. Pick one that feels comfortable and stick with it. They all work—it's just a matter of what fits your style.
________________


[Practical advice]
Here's my advice for your first few bakes: use the stretch and fold method. It's forgiving, it gives you time to watch what's happening with your dough, and it works beautifully for sourdough. After each set of folds, do a windowpane test. Track your progress. By the third or fourth set, you should have full development.
[Summarize]
So to recap this section:
* Use bread flour for sourdough. It's got the protein you need.
* Gluten is what gives your dough structure and the ability to rise.
* The windowpane test is your best tool for checking development.
* Stretch and fold is your friend—let time and gentle handling do the work.
Any questions on gluten development before we move into fermentation?
[Take 1-2 questions, then transition]
Great. So now you've got a starter that's active, you've mixed your dough, and you've developed your gluten. Next question: how long do you wait before you shape it? That's all about fermentation. Let's talk about bulk.


PART 3: FERMENTATION, SHAPING & SCHEDULING
PART 3: FERMENTATION, SHAPING & SCHEDULING (32 minutes)
________________


3A: Bulk Fermentation Explained (8 min)
[Transition from gluten section]
Alright, so you've mixed your dough, you've developed your gluten. Now what? You wait. But you're not just waiting—you're fermenting. This is bulk fermentation, and it's where the magic happens.
[What's happening during bulk]
During bulk fermentation, your starter is eating the sugars in the flour and producing carbon dioxide and acids. That CO2 is getting trapped in your gluten network, which makes the dough expand. At the same time, those acids are developing flavor and breaking down the dough in ways that make it more digestible and more delicious.
This is the longest part of your process—usually 4-6 hours at room temperature, but it could be 8-10 hours if it's cold, or 3 hours if it's really warm. The key is: you're not watching the clock. You're watching the dough.
[Bring out fermentation samples - have 3 bowls ready]
I've got three dough samples here, all from the same recipe, but they've been fermenting for different amounts of time. This is what you need to learn to recognize.
________________


[Sample #1 - underfermented]
Underfermented Dough
Look at this one.
[Show the bowl, tilt it so they can see]
What do you notice? It's only risen a little bit—maybe 25-30%. If I look at the surface, I can see a few small bubbles, but not many. The dough is still pretty dense.
[Poke test demonstration]
Watch this. I'm going to poke it with my finger.
[Poke the dough firmly]
See how it springs back almost immediately? That means there's still a lot of tension in the dough. The gluten is tight. The yeast hasn't produced enough gas yet to really expand the network.
[What this means]
If you shaped and baked this dough right now, you'd get a loaf that's dense, tight-crumbed, maybe a little gummy. It wouldn't have that open, airy texture you're looking for. The yeast hasn't done its job yet. This dough needs more time.
________________


[Sample #2 - properly fermented]
Properly Fermented Dough
Now look at this one. See the difference?
[Show the bowl]
This dough has risen significantly—maybe 50-75% larger than when I started. That's the range we're aiming for. Not doubled, necessarily, but definitely expanded.
[Point to the surface]
Look at the surface. You can see bubbles all over—some small, some larger. There's activity everywhere. If I tilt the bowl—
[Tilt the bowl gently]
—the dough jiggles. It's got air in it. It feels alive.
[Poke test]
Now watch the poke test on this one.
[Poke the dough]
See that? My finger goes in, and the dough springs back slowly—maybe halfway. That's what we're looking for. It's got some spring, but it's relaxed. The gluten has loosened up a bit. There's gas in there, but the structure is still intact.
[Smell it]
Come up here and smell this if you want. It smells yeasty, a little tangy, but it's pleasant. It's not harsh or boozy. That's a good fermented dough smell.
[What this means]
This dough is ready to shape. If you shape and bake this, you're going to get good oven spring, a nice open crumb, and great flavor. This is the sweet spot.
________________


[Sample #3 - overfermented]
Overfermented Dough
And then we have this one. This is what happens when you wait too long.
[Show the bowl - the dough may look flattened or collapsed]
Look at the surface. It's not domed anymore—it might even be starting to collapse. You can see really large, irregular bubbles, and the dough looks... loose. Almost wet.
[Poke test]
Watch the poke test.
[Poke the dough - finger may go in easily and not spring back]
My finger goes in and the indent just stays there. No spring at all. The gluten structure has started to break down. The acids have weakened it, and the yeast has burned through all the available food.
[Smell it]
And the smell? It's really sour—maybe even boozy or vinegary. That's overfermentation.
[What this means]
If you try to shape this dough, it's going to be a nightmare. It'll be sticky, it won't hold tension, and it'll spread out instead of rising up in the oven. You might still be able to bake it—it won't be a disaster—but it's not going to be your best loaf. The texture will be gummy, the crumb will be uneven with big holes and dense spots, and it'll taste really sour.
[Pass samples around if possible]
Go ahead and pass these around. Touch them. Poke them. Get a sense for what these different stages feel like.
________________


[Temperature talk]
Now, here's the thing about timing. I said bulk fermentation usually takes 4-6 hours, but that's at room temperature—let's say 70-75°F. If your kitchen is 80°F in the summer, it might only take 3 hours. If it's 65°F in the winter, it could take 8 or more.
Temperature controls everything. Warmer = faster fermentation. Cooler = slower fermentation.
[Practical advice]
So here's what I recommend: pick a consistent spot in your kitchen. Maybe it's on top of your fridge, maybe it's in a cabinet, wherever. Use that spot every time, and learn how your dough behaves there. Take notes. "Bulk took 5 hours at 72°F." Next time, you'll have a baseline.
And use the visual and tactile cues we just talked about—volume increase, jiggle, poke test. Those will never lie to you. The clock will.
________________


[The poke test - emphasize it]
Let me emphasize the poke test one more time because it's so useful.
[Demonstrate again on the properly fermented dough]
Flour your finger. Gently poke the dough about half an inch deep.
* Springs back fast: Not ready yet. Keep fermenting.
* Springs back slowly, halfway: Perfect. Ready to shape.
* Doesn't spring back: You've gone too far. Shape it anyway and bake it, but make a note for next time.
This test works for bulk fermentation, and it works for your final proof too. Master this, and you'll never have to guess.
________________


[Transition to shaping]
Alright, so you've got a properly fermented dough. What's next? You shape it. Let me show you what that looks like.
________________


3B: Shaping Demonstration (7 min)
[Bring out the properly fermented dough sample]
So this dough has gone through bulk fermentation—it's expanded, it's bubbly, it's relaxed. Now we need to give it structure and tension before the final proof.
[Important caveat]
Now, I'm going to show you a basic boule shape today—that's just a round loaf. In a future class, we'll dive deep into different shaping techniques, troubleshooting, and all that. But today, I just want you to see what this step looks like and why it matters.
________________


[Turn dough out onto surface]
First, I'm going to lightly flour my work surface and turn the dough out.
[Gently turn dough out of bowl]
See how it's relaxed? It wants to spread out. My job now is to create tension on the surface so it holds its shape and rises up instead of out.
[Pre-shape if doing it]
Some bakers do a pre-shape here—a gentle round to organize the dough—then let it rest for 20-30 minutes before the final shape. That rest is called a bench rest. For today, I'm going to skip that and go straight to the final shape, but just know that's an option.
________________


[Shaping technique - boule]
[Demonstrate shaping]
I'm going to fold the edges of the dough toward the center, working my way around in a circle.
[Fold edges in, rotating the dough]
Each fold, I'm pulling the dough gently and folding it into the middle. This is creating layers and building tension on what will become the bottom of the loaf.
[Flip it over]
Now I flip it over so the smooth side—the top—is facing up, and the seam side is on the counter.
[Cupping motion]
Now I'm going to cup my hands around the dough and use the friction between the dough and the counter to create surface tension. I'm gently pulling the dough toward me in little circular motions.
[Demonstrate the dragging/tension building]
See that? The surface is tightening up. It's getting smooth and taut. I'm not pressing down—I'm using the stickiness of the dough on the counter to create that tension.
[Show the final shaped dough]
And there we go. Look at that surface. It's smooth, it's got tension. If I leave this alone for a minute, it's going to hold its shape. That's what we're after.
________________


[Why this matters]
Why do we care about shaping?
Surface tension is what gives your loaf structure. Without it, the dough will spread in the oven instead of rising up. Proper tension = better oven spring.
Seam side down (or up in a banneton) helps everything stay together. If your seam is weak or your tension is poor, the dough can bust open in weird places during baking.
________________


[How fermentation affects shaping]
Now, here's the connection to what we just talked about.
[Gesture to the three fermentation samples]
If I tried to shape the underfermented dough, it'd be really tight and hard to work with. It wouldn't want to relax or stretch. I'd be fighting it.
If I tried to shape the overfermented dough, it'd be a sticky mess. It wouldn't hold tension. It'd just slump and spread.
But this properly fermented dough? It's relaxed but still has structure. It's easy to shape, and it responds to my hands. That's why getting bulk fermentation right is so important—it sets you up for success in shaping.
________________


[Final point]
After you shape, the dough goes into a banneton or a bowl for its final proof. We'll talk about that in just a minute. But I wanted you to see this step because it's the bridge between bulk fermentation and the final rise. You're organizing the dough, giving it structure, and preparing it for the oven.
[In the binder]
There are step-by-step photos of shaping techniques in your binder on page [X]. Practice this at home. It's awkward the first few times, but by your third or fourth loaf, it'll feel natural.
Any quick questions on shaping?
[Take 1 quick question if needed, then move on]
________________


3C: Creating Your Baking Schedule (12 min)
[Transition]
Alright, now let's talk about the big picture. You know how to maintain your starter, you know how to develop gluten, you know what bulk fermentation looks like. But how do you actually fit all of this into your life?
This is where a lot of beginners get stuck. They see recipes that say "Day 1: Feed starter. Day 2: Mix dough. Day 3: Bake." And they think, "I don't have three full days to babysit bread."
Good news: you don't have to.
[The key principle]
Here's the secret: you work backwards from when you want fresh bread. You decide: I want a fresh loaf Saturday morning at 9 AM. Now you reverse-engineer the timeline to make that happen.
Let me show you how.
________________


[Scenario 1: Weekend Morning Bake]
Scenario 1: Fresh Bread Saturday Morning
Let's say you want to pull a fresh loaf out of the oven at 9 AM on Saturday. Maybe you're having people over for brunch, or you just want fresh bread for the weekend.
[Walk through the timeline backwards]
9:00 AM Saturday - Bread comes out of the oven Baking takes about 45 minutes, so...
8:15 AM Saturday - Bread goes in the oven Before that, I need to score it, load it, etc. Let's say 15 minutes of prep, so...
8:00 AM Saturday - Final proof is done Cold proofing in the fridge overnight usually takes 8-12 hours, so...
8:00 PM Friday night - Shaped dough goes in the fridge Before shaping, bulk fermentation takes 4-6 hours (let's say 5), so...
3:00 PM Friday afternoon - Mix the dough Before that, my starter needs to be at peak, which takes 4-6 hours after feeding, so...
9:00 AM Friday morning - Feed the starter
[Summarize]
So there's your schedule. Friday morning, feed your starter. Friday afternoon, mix your dough. Friday evening, shape it and put it in the fridge. Saturday morning, bake it.
Total active time? Maybe 30-45 minutes spread across two days. The rest is just waiting.
________________


[Scenario 2: Weeknight Bake]
Scenario 2: Weeknight Bake with Overnight Proof
Now let's say you work during the day and you want fresh bread on a Tuesday night when you get home from work.
[Walk through the timeline]
6:30 PM Tuesday - Bread comes out of the oven Baking takes 45 minutes, so...
5:45 PM Tuesday - Bread goes in the oven I need to score and load, so let's back up to...
5:30 PM Tuesday - Final proof is done This one's been cold proofing since last night—let's say 12 hours, so...
5:30 AM Tuesday morning - Shaped dough goes in the fridge Before that, bulk fermentation overnight—let's say 8 hours in a cool kitchen (65-68°F), so...
9:30 PM Monday night - Mix the dough Starter needs to be ready, which takes 4-6 hours after feeding, so...
4:00 PM Monday afternoon - Feed the starter
[Summarize]
So you feed your starter Monday when you get home from work. You mix the dough before bed. You shape it first thing Tuesday morning and stick it in the fridge before you leave for work. You bake it Tuesday evening when you get home.
See how it works? You're using time—especially cold time in the fridge—to your advantage.
________________


[Scenario 3: Long Cold Proof Method]
Scenario 3: The Long Cold Proof (Maximum Flexibility)
This is my favorite method for beginners because it gives you a ton of flexibility.
[Explain the concept]
You mix your dough, let it bulk ferment, shape it, and then stick it in the fridge for anywhere from 12 to 48 hours—sometimes even longer. Cold fermentation slows everything way down, which means you can bake whenever it's convenient.
[Example timeline]
Let's say you mix and shape on Saturday afternoon. You could bake Sunday morning. Or Sunday night. Or Monday evening. Or even Tuesday. The dough is just hanging out in the fridge, slowly developing flavor, waiting for you.
[Why this is great]
This method is forgiving. If life happens and you can't bake when you planned, no big deal—just leave it in the fridge another day. It also develops incredible flavor because of that slow, cold fermentation.
[One caution]
The longer it goes, the more sour it gets. If you like mild sourdough, bake it after 12-18 hours. If you like it tangy, let it go 36-48 hours. Beyond 48 hours, you might start to see over-fermentation issues—but you've got a big window to work with.
________________


[Flexibility points in the timeline]
Let me point out where you have flexibility in any schedule:
1. Starter feeding: You can feed it the night before instead of the morning of. Just use a bigger ratio (like 1:5:5) to slow it down.
2. Bulk fermentation: You can speed it up by keeping the dough in a warm spot (75-80°F), or slow it down by keeping it cool (65-70°F). Every degree matters.
3. Cold proof: This is your "pause button." Once the dough is shaped and in the fridge, you control when you bake. 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours—it's up to you.
________________


[Using the fridge as a pause button]
This is worth emphasizing. The fridge is your best friend.
[Example]
Let's say you're in the middle of bulk fermentation, and something comes up—you have to leave the house, or you're just tired and want to go to bed. Stick the dough in the fridge. Fermentation will slow to a crawl. When you're ready to continue, pull it out, let it come back to room temp, and keep going.
Same thing after shaping. Once it's in the banneton and in the fridge, it's in stasis. Bake it when you're ready.
________________


[Temperature adjustments]
Quick note on temperature, because this is huge.
Warmer = faster. If you want to speed things up, find a warm spot. On top of the fridge, inside a turned-off oven with the light on, near (not on) a radiator. Just don't go above 85°F or you'll get funky flavors.
Cooler = slower. If you want to slow things down—maybe you're going to be out longer than you thought—move the dough to a cooler spot. Basement, unheated room, whatever. You're buying yourself time.
In the summer, I sometimes put my dough in a cooler with an ice pack to keep it from fermenting too fast. In the winter, I might put it near a heater. You're managing temperature to manage time.
________________


[Reference the binder]
In your binder, you've got several pre-built schedules on page [X]:
* Weekend morning bake
* Weeknight bake
* Long cold proof
* Same-day bake (for when you're home all day)
Use these as templates. Once you do a few bakes, you'll start to develop your own rhythms and schedules that work for your life.
________________


[The big takeaway]
Here's the big takeaway: sourdough is flexible. You're not a slave to the dough. You control the timeline by managing temperature and using the fridge strategically.
Don't let anyone tell you that you have to bake at a specific time on a specific day. Build a schedule that works for you.
________________


3D: Final Fermentation (Proof) Overview (5 min)
[Transition]
Alright, last piece of the fermentation puzzle: the final proof, also called the final rise or just "proofing."
[Bulk vs. proof - what's the difference?]
So what's the difference between bulk fermentation and final fermentation?
Bulk fermentation happens after you mix the dough and before you shape it. The dough is in a big mass, fermenting as one unit, and you're developing flavor, strength, and volume.
Final fermentation happens after you shape the dough. Now it's in its final form—usually in a banneton or a bowl—and it's doing its last bit of rising before it goes in the oven.
The yeast is still producing CO2, the dough is still expanding, but now you're working with a shaped loaf that's gaining its final structure.
________________


[Cold proof advantages]
Most of the schedules I showed you use a cold proof, and here's why that's great for beginners:
1. Convenience. You can proof overnight or even for a couple days. It fits into your life instead of demanding you be home at a specific time.
2. Flavor. Cold fermentation develops deeper, more complex flavors. The longer, slower process gives you a more interesting loaf.
3. Easier to score. Cold dough is firmer, which makes it way easier to score right before baking. Room-temperature dough can be sticky and soft—cold dough handles like a dream.
4. Forgiving. The cold slows everything down, so you've got a bigger window before over-proofing becomes an issue.
________________


[Room temperature proof - quick mention]
You can also do a room-temperature final proof. This usually takes 2-4 hours depending on temperature. It's faster, but it requires you to be around to catch it at the right moment. For beginners, I usually recommend starting with cold proofs just because they're more forgiving.
________________


[Poke test for proof readiness]
Remember the poke test we did during bulk fermentation? It works here too.
[Demonstrate if you have a proofed dough]
Take your dough out of the fridge (or if it's been at room temp, test it in the banneton). Flour your finger, gently poke the dough.
* Springs back quickly: Underproofed. Needs more time.
* Springs back slowly, leaves a slight indent: Perfect. Ready to bake.
* Doesn't spring back, indent stays: Overproofed. Bake it anyway, but expect less oven spring.
If you're baking straight from the fridge, you can actually bake it slightly underproofed because it'll get a final boost of rise in the oven. That's one of the advantages of cold proofing—you get better oven spring.
________________


[What's next - baking and scoring]
So after your final proof, you're ready to bake. You'll score the dough, load it into a hot oven—ideally into a preheated Dutch oven or on a baking stone—and let the heat do its thing.
We're not covering scoring and baking in detail today. That's going to be a whole class on its own. But just know: after proofing, you're about 45 minutes away from fresh bread.
________________


[Recap fermentation and proofing]
Let me recap the fermentation stages one more time because this is where beginners get lost:
1. Mix your dough → fully incorporate ingredients, develop gluten
2. Bulk fermentation → 4-6 hours (or longer if cold), dough expands 50-75%, poke test shows slow spring-back
3. Shape the dough → build surface tension, create structure
4. Final fermentation (proof) → in banneton, usually overnight in fridge (12-48 hours)
5. Bake → score, load into hot oven, bake ~45 minutes
Each stage builds on the last. If you nail bulk fermentation, shaping is easy. If you nail shaping, your proof will go well. If you nail the proof, your bake will be beautiful.
And all of it starts with an active, healthy starter.
________________


[Transition to wrap-up]
Alright, we've covered a lot today. Let's bring it all together.


WRAP-UP & TAKEAWAYS
WRAP-UP & TAKEAWAYS (5 minutes)
________________


[Take a breath, shift energy to closing]
Alright everyone, let's bring this all together. You've absorbed a lot in the last 90 minutes, and I want to make sure you leave here with clear next steps.
[Review key success factors]
If you remember nothing else from today, remember these five things:
________________


[Hold up one finger]
One: Keep your starter on a consistent schedule.
Whether you're feeding it daily at room temperature or weekly in the fridge, consistency is key. Your starter will adapt to your routine, but it needs that routine. Feed it the same way, at roughly the same time, and it'll reward you with reliable performance.
And use the float test. That's your insurance policy. If it floats, you're good to bake.
________________


[Two fingers]
Two: Use the right flour for your recipe.
Bread flour for sourdough. High protein. That's your foundation. Once you understand how dough should behave, then you can start experimenting with all-purpose or whole grains. But for your first several loaves? Bread flour. Keep it simple.
________________


[Three fingers]
Three: Master the windowpane test for mixing.
This is your best tool for knowing when your gluten is fully developed. If you can stretch the dough thin enough to see light through it without it tearing, you're done. No guessing, no wondering. The dough will tell you.
________________


[Four fingers]
Four: Learn to read fermentation cues, not just the clock.
Time is a guideline, but temperature changes everything. Your kitchen in July is different from your kitchen in January. Watch the dough. Look for that 50-75% volume increase. Watch for bubbles. Do the poke test. The dough will tell you when it's ready—trust it more than the timer.
________________


[Five fingers]
Five: Plan your timeline before you start.
Work backwards from when you want fresh bread. Map it out. Write it down if you need to. And remember: the fridge is your pause button. If life happens, you can always slow things down or speed them up. Sourdough is flexible—it works around your schedule, not the other way around.
________________


[Point to the binders]
Now, let's talk about what you're taking home with you today.
________________


Binder Contents Overview
[Pick up a binder, flip through it as you talk]
Your binder is organized into sections, and each section corresponds to what we covered today. Think of this as your reference guide—when you're at home at 10 PM wondering "wait, what did Scott say about the poke test?", this is where you look.
[Go through the sections]
Section 1: Starter Maintenance You've got a feeding schedule chart here with different scenarios—daily feeding, weekly feeding, getting ready for a bake. There's also a visual guide showing what an active starter looks like versus a sluggish one. Use those photos. Compare them to your starter at home.
Section 2: Flour Guide A quick reference on flour types, protein contents, and when to use what. Bread flour, all-purpose, whole wheat—it's all in here.
Section 3: Gluten Development Step-by-step photos of the windowpane test, descriptions of undermixed versus fully developed dough, and guides for different mixing methods—stretch and fold, slap and fold, coil folds. Pick the method that feels right and practice it.
Section 4: Fermentation Stages Photos of underfermented, properly fermented, and overfermented dough. Visual cues, poke test results, what to look for. This section alone will save you from so many mistakes.
Section 5: Shaping Techniques Basic boule shaping with step-by-step photos. We'll go deeper in future classes, but this will get you started.
Section 6: Baking Schedules Four pre-built schedules: weekend morning bake, weeknight bake, long cold proof, and same-day bake. Use these as templates. Adjust them to your life. Write notes in the margins about what worked and what didn't.
Section 7: Recipes Three beginner-friendly recipes. A basic country loaf, a slightly higher hydration loaf, and a whole wheat blend. All written in baker's percentages with gram measurements. Start with the basic country loaf—nail that one first, then experiment.
Section 8: Troubleshooting Guide This is your troubleshooting FAQ. "My dough is too sticky." "My starter smells weird." "My bread didn't rise." Common problems, common solutions. Check here before you panic.
Section 9: Glossary All the terms we used today—bulk fermentation, windowpane test, oven spring, autolyse, banneton—defined clearly. If you hear a term and you're not sure what it means, look it up here.
Section 10: Baker's Percentage Reference A primer on how baker's percentages work. You don't need to master this on day one, but it's here when you're ready to understand the math behind the recipes.
Section 11: Class Notes Blank pages for you to write your own notes. Document your bakes. Track times, temperatures, what worked, what didn't. This becomes your personal baking journal.

[Set the binder down]
This binder is yours. Write in it. Dog-ear the pages. Spill flour on it. It's a tool, not a museum piece. Use it.
________________


Q&A + Starter Care Instructions
[Shift to the starter jars]
Alright, now let's talk about your starter. You're each going home with a jar of active starter—this is the same culture we use here at SLO Food Market. It's healthy, it's active, and it's ready to work for you.
[Critical first feeding timeline]
Here's what you need to do when you get home:
If you're planning to bake in the next day or two, leave it on your counter and feed it once a day—equal parts starter, flour, and water by weight. Keep it at room temperature, and it'll be ready whenever you need it.
If you're NOT planning to bake right away, let it sit at room temperature for a couple hours so it can wake up and start showing some activity, then stick it in the fridge. It'll be fine there for a week. When you're ready to bake, pull it out the night before, feed it, and let it come to room temperature and peak.
[Feeding reminder]
Remember: 1:1:1 is your default ratio. 50 grams starter, 50 grams flour, 50 grams water. If you want to slow it down, use a bigger ratio like 1:5:5. It's all in the binder.
[Encourage practice]
My advice? Do a practice bake this week or next. Don't wait a month. The sooner you get your hands in dough, the sooner this will all click. Your first loaf might not be perfect—that's fine. The goal is to learn what the dough feels like, what your kitchen temperature does to timing, and how your schedule works.
By your third or fourth loaf, you'll feel confident. By your tenth, you'll be hooked.
________________


[Open the floor]
Alright, we've got a few minutes left. What questions do you have? Anything we covered today that you want me to clarify?
[Take questions - be prepared for common ones like:]
* "How much starter do I need to keep?"
* "What do I do with all the discard?"
* "Can I use whole wheat flour in my starter?"
* "What if my kitchen is really cold/hot?"
* "How do I know if my starter is dead?"
* "Can I freeze starter?"
* "What's the best banneton to buy?"
[Answer 2-3 questions, keep it conversational]
________________


[If no more questions or time is running out]
[Final encouragement]
Alright, if there are no more questions, let me leave you with this:
Sourdough has a reputation for being difficult, but it's not. It's actually really forgiving once you understand what you're looking at. The dough will tell you what it needs if you pay attention. Trust your senses—your eyes, your hands, your nose. They're better than any timer or thermometer.
And remember: every baker has made bad loaves. I've made hundreds of bad loaves. That's how you learn. So don't get discouraged if your first one doesn't turn out perfect. Adjust, try again, and keep going.
You've got everything you need now—the knowledge, the starter, the recipes, the support materials. Now it's just about doing it.
________________

SECTION 10: TROUBLESHOOTING GALLERY (3-4 pages)
Color: Dark gray
This is the "what went wrong" section
Layout: Problem/Photo/Solution format
Common failures with photos:
Problem 1: Dense, Gummy Crumb
* Photo of sliced loaf showing dense interior
* Likely causes:
   * Underfermented bulk
   * Starter wasn't active enough
   * Didn't develop gluten fully
* Fix for next time:
   * Check: starter passes float test
   * Check: windowpane test passes
   * Check: dough rises 50-75% in bulk
Problem 2: Flat Loaf, No Oven Spring
* Photo
* Likely causes: Overfermented
* Fix: Watch for poke test, don't let bulk go too long
Problem 3: Huge Holes + Dense Spots
* Photo
* Likely causes: Poor shaping, uneven fermentation
* Fix: Practice shaping tension, ensure even folds during bulk
Problem 4: Pale Crust
* Photo
* Likely causes: Oven temp too low, not enough steam
* Fix: Preheat Dutch oven longer, check oven temp
Problem 5: Crust Too Dark, Interior Undercooked
* Photo
* Likely causes: Oven too hot, not baked long enough
* Fix: Lower temp by 25°F, bake longer
Problem 6: Loaf Spread Out Instead of Up
* Photo
* Likely causes: Too wet, poor shaping, overproofed
* Fix: Check hydration, practice shaping, watch proof time

PAGE 2: FLOUR GUIDE
Understanding Flour for Sourdough
Not all flour is created equal. The protein content in flour determines how much gluten can form, which affects your bread's structure, rise, and texture. Here's what you need to know.
________________


FLOUR TYPES COMPARISON
Flour Type
	Protein Content
	Best For
	Water Absorption
	Notes
	Bread Flour
	12-13%
	Sourdough loaves, artisan breads
	Standard
	START HERE - Gives best structure and rise
	All-Purpose Flour
	10-11%
	Softer breads, feeding starter
	Standard
	Less gluten = less structure; softer crumb
	Whole Wheat Flour
	13-14%
	Adding flavor, nutrition, color
	High (absorbs more water)
	Use 10-30% in your total flour; ferments faster
	Rye Flour
	Variable
	Distinctive tangy flavor
	Very high
	Use 10-20% max; very little gluten
	White Whole Wheat
	13-14%
	Lighter whole grain option
	High
	Milder than regular whole wheat
	________________


WHY PROTEIN MATTERS
Protein = Gluten Formation = Structure
When you mix flour and water and work the dough, two proteins in flour (glutenin and gliadin) link together to form gluten. This gluten network:
* Traps gas produced by yeast
* Gives dough strength and elasticity
* Allows bread to rise up instead of spreading out
* Creates that chewy texture
Higher protein flour → Stronger gluten network → Better rise and structure
________________


WHICH FLOUR SHOULD YOU USE?
For Your First 5-10 Loaves:
Use bread flour. That's it.
Don't experiment yet. Get comfortable with one flour so you learn what the dough should feel like, how it should rise, how it should behave. Once you've baked 5-10 successful loaves with bread flour, THEN start experimenting.
Once You're Comfortable:
Try adding whole grains for flavor and nutrition:
* Start with 10-20% whole wheat in place of bread flour
* Increase slowly to 30-50% if you like it
* Note: Whole grains absorb more water and ferment faster
For Feeding Your Starter:
All-purpose flour works great and is more economical for daily/weekly feedings. You can also use bread flour. Either works.
________________


BRAND RECOMMENDATIONS
What we use at SLO Food Market:
* Bread Flour: [Your actual flour brand]
* Whole Wheat: [Your actual flour brand if different]
Other excellent options:
* King Arthur Bread Flour (widely available, very consistent)
* Central Milling Artisan Bakers Craft (high quality, great for sourdough)
* Bob's Red Mill Artisan Bread Flour (good, available at most groceries)
What matters most: Consistency. Pick one brand and stick with it while you're learning. Different brands behave slightly differently, and you want to eliminate variables while you're figuring this out.
________________


COMMON QUESTIONS
Q: Can I use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour? A: Yes, but your dough will be softer, have less structure, and won't rise as dramatically. If you're already comfortable with sourdough, go for it. If you're a beginner, stick with bread flour.
Q: Does organic vs. non-organic matter? A: Not for learning. Once you're comfortable, experiment if you want. Organic flours can perform slightly differently.
Q: What about "high-protein" or "high-gluten" flour? A: That's 13-14% protein. It's great for bagels and very chewy breads, but bread flour (12-13%) is perfect for sourdough.
Q: Can I mix different brands? A: Yes, but while you're learning, keep it simple. One brand, one type.
________________


HOW WHOLE GRAINS CHANGE THINGS
When you add whole wheat, rye, or other whole grain flours:
1. More Water Needed The bran in whole grains absorbs more water. You may need to add 5-10g extra water per 100g of whole grain flour.
2. Faster Fermentation
 Whole grains have more nutrients for yeast to eat. Your bulk fermentation might be 30-60 minutes faster.
3. Denser Crumb The bran cuts through gluten strands. You'll get a tighter, denser crumb. That's normal and delicious.
4. Deeper Flavor Whole grains add nutty, earthy, complex flavors. This is why we use them!
________________


STORAGE TIPS
Bread Flour & All-Purpose:
* Cool, dry place for up to 6 months
* Airtight container helps keep it fresh
Whole Wheat & Whole Grains:
* Refrigerate or freeze for longer storage
* The oils in the germ can go rancid at room temp
* Use within 3-4 months for best flavor
________________


PAGE 3: WHY USE A SCALE?
The #1 Tool for Consistent Baking
If you take away nothing else from this class, take away this: Buy a kitchen scale. Here's why it matters.
________________


THE PROBLEM WITH MEASURING CUPS
"1 cup of flour" can vary by 30-50 grams depending on:
* How you scoop it (digging in vs. spooning)
* How packed down the flour is in the bag
* Humidity in the air
* Whether you level it off or heap it
Real example:
* Scooped and packed: 1 cup = 140-150g
* Spooned and leveled: 1 cup = 120-125g
* Fluffed and spooned: 1 cup = 110-115g
That's a 30-40g difference - almost 25% more or less flour!
In bread baking, that difference can mean:
* Dough that's too stiff and dry → dense bread
* Dough that's too wet and slack → flat bread that spreads
________________


WHY PROFESSIONAL BAKERS USE WEIGHT
Precision 50 grams of flour is 50 grams of flour, every single time, no matter who measures it or how they scoop it.
Consistency
 When you make the same recipe twice with a scale, you get the same results. With cups? You might not.
Baker's Percentages Professional recipes are written in percentages of the total flour weight. This is the universal language of baking. A scale lets you understand and use these recipes.
Easy Adjustments Want to make 1.5x the recipe? Or half? Easy math with weight. Confusing with cups.
________________


"BUT I DON'T HAVE A SCALE YET..."
If you're not ready to buy a scale, here are the most accurate conversions for the recipes in this binder. But please get a scale soon - it will transform your baking.
FLOUR CONVERSIONS (Use "spoon and level" method)
How to measure without a scale:
1. Fluff the flour in the bag with a spoon
2. Spoon flour into the measuring cup (don't pack it)
3. Level off with a knife
Approximate conversions:
* 1 cup bread flour = 120g
* 1 cup all-purpose flour = 120g
* 1 cup whole wheat flour = 113g
WATER (easy):
* 1 cup water = 227g
* 1/2 cup water = 113g
* 1/4 cup water = 57g
STARTER:
* 1 cup active starter (stirred down) = 227g
* 1/2 cup active starter = 113g
SALT:
* 1 teaspoon table salt = 6g
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt = 6g
* ⚠️ 1 teaspoon Morton's kosher salt = 5g
* ⚠️ 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt = 3g
________________


WHAT KIND OF SCALE TO BUY
Must-haves: ✓ Measures in grams (essential) ✓ Capacity of at least 2kg / 2000g / 4.4 lbs ✓ Tare function (zero out the weight of the bowl) ✓ Easy-to-read display
Nice-to-haves:
* Auto shut-off (to save battery)
* Flat design (easier to clean)
* Pull-out display (so you can see it when a big bowl is on top)
What to spend:
* Basic: $15-20 (Ozeri, Greater Goods)
* Mid-range: $25-35 (Escali, OXO)
* Professional: $40+ (My Weigh, Acaia)
For home baking, a $20-25 scale is perfect.
________________


HOW TO USE A SCALE
Basic Process:
1. Place bowl on scale
2. Press "Tare" or "Zero" - Scale reads 0g
3. Add your first ingredient (e.g., flour)
4. Press "Tare" again - Scale reads 0g again
5. Add your next ingredient (e.g., water)
6. Press "Tare" again
7. Repeat until all ingredients are in
One bowl, one scale, perfectly measured ingredients. Easy.
________________


COMMON QUESTIONS
Q: Do I really NEED a scale? A: For sourdough? Yes. For consistent results? Absolutely. It's the single best $20 you'll spend on your baking.
Q: Can I use a postal scale? A: If it measures in grams and goes up to at least 2kg, yes.
Q: What about a scale that only measures in ounces? A: Not ideal. Grams give you much more precision. 1 ounce = 28 grams, so you're losing a lot of accuracy.
Q: My scale turns off while I'm measuring. What do I do? A: Most scales auto-shutoff after 1-2 minutes of no activity. Just tap the bowl or add a tiny bit of flour to "wake it up."
________________


THE BOTTOM LINE
Volume (cups) = Inconsistent Weight (grams) = Consistent
All the recipes in this binder are written in grams. All the techniques we taught you assume you're weighing ingredients. If you want to succeed with sourdough - not just once, but every time - get a scale.
Your bread will thank you.

Keep this page out while you bake - it has everything you need to make the right calls
________________


LEFT COLUMN
________________


IS MY STARTER READY TO USE?
✓ YES - Ready to bake when you see ALL of these:
* ✓ Doubled in size (or close to it)
* ✓ Domed top (not flat, not collapsed)
* ✓ Bubbles on surface (lots of them)
* ✓ Fresh, tangy smell (not harsh or boozy)
* ✓ Passes float test (small spoonful floats in water)
✗ NO - Not ready yet:
* Only risen a little
* Flat or collapsed top
* Few bubbles
* Smells like acetone/nail polish remover
* Sinks in float test
→ Feed it again and wait for peak activity
________________


STARTER FEEDING RATIOS
Quick feeding (1:1:1)
* 50g starter + 50g flour + 50g water
* Ready in: 4-6 hours
* Use when: Baking same day
Slow feeding (1:5:5)
* 20g starter + 100g flour + 100g water
* Ready in: 8-12 hours
* Use when: Want it ready in the morning
Fridge storage:
* Feed with 1:5:5 or 1:10:10 ratio
* Let sit 1-2 hours at room temp
* Then refrigerate
* Feed once a week
________________


IS MY DOUGH MIXED ENOUGH?
THE WINDOWPANE TEST
How to do it:
1. Take a small piece of dough
2. Stretch it gently between your fingers
3. Try to make it thin enough to see light through
✓ PASS: Thin, translucent membrane without tearing → Gluten is fully developed, ready to bulk ferment
✗ FAIL: Tears immediately or before translucent
→ Keep folding, test again in 30 minutes
________________


RIGHT COLUMN
________________


IS MY BULK FERMENTATION DONE?
Visual Check:
* ✓ Dough has risen 50-75% in volume
* ✓ Surface is bubbly and domed
* ✓ Dough jiggles when you move the bowl
* ✓ You can see bubbles through the side of bowl
The Poke Test:
Flour your finger, poke dough ½ inch deep
Springs back FAST (in 1-2 seconds) → NOT READY - Keep fermenting
Springs back SLOWLY (halfway in 3-5 seconds)
 → ✓ READY TO SHAPE
Doesn't spring back at all → OVERPROOFED - Shape anyway, bake it, learn for next time
________________


IS MY FINAL PROOF DONE?
For Cold Proofed Dough (from fridge):
* 12-18 hours: Mild flavor, max oven spring
* 24-36 hours: More sour, good spring
* 36-48 hours: Very sour, less spring
Poke test after removing from fridge:
* Slow spring-back = ready
* You can bake slightly underproofed from cold - you'll get great oven spring
For Room Temp Proofed Dough:
Use poke test:
* Slow spring-back = ready (usually 2-4 hours)
* No spring-back = overproofed
________________


TEMPERATURE MATTERS
Warmer = Faster | Cooler = Slower
Bulk Fermentation Times by Temperature:
Kitchen Temp
	Typical Bulk Time
	80°F
	3-4 hours
	75°F
	4-5 hours ← Sweet spot
	70°F
	5-6 hours
	65°F
	7-8 hours
	60°F
	10-12 hours
	Find your warmest spot:
* Top of refrigerator
* Inside turned-off oven (with light on)
* Near (not on) a heater
________________


THE FRIDGE IS YOUR FRIEND
Use it as a PAUSE BUTTON:
During bulk fermentation: Dough fermenting too fast? Stick it in the fridge. It'll slow way down. Pull it out when you're ready to continue.
After shaping: This is the best time to use cold. Shape your loaf, put it in the fridge, and bake it anytime in the next 12-48 hours. Total flexibility.
________________


BOTTOM SECTION (full width)
________________


⚠️ WHEN IN DOUBT...
Starter not sure if it's ready? → Do the float test. It doesn't lie.
Dough feels different than expected? → Trust the visual/tactile cues (windowpane, volume, poke test) more than the clock.
Not sure if bulk is done? → Better to shape a little early than too late. Underfermented bread is dense but edible. Overfermented bread is a sticky mess.
Life interrupted your schedule? → Put it in the fridge. Always. It buys you time.
Something went wrong? → Bake it anyway. You learn more from failures than successes.
________________


BASIC TIMELINE AT-A-GLANCE
Feed starter → 4-6 hours → Mix dough → 5-6 hours → Shape → 12-48 hours (fridge) → Score & Bake → 45 min → BREAD!
Total active time: About 30-45 minutes spread across 1-2 days

THE BASIC PRINCIPLE
Sourdough baking is a series of simple steps with waiting in between. You're not actively working for hours - you're doing 2-5 minute tasks spread across a day and a half.
The yeast does most of the work. You just create the right conditions and then get out of the way.
Ready? Let's bake.
________________


PAGES 2-3: STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
________________


STEP 1: FEED YOUR STARTER
Friday, 9:00 AM | Active time: 5 minutes
What you're doing: Waking up your starter and building enough active starter for your dough (300g).
How to do it:
1. Remove starter from fridge (if stored cold)
2. In a clean jar: Combine 30g ripe starter + 135g all-purpose flour + 135g water
3. Stir until no dry flour remains
4. Cover loosely (not airtight)
5. Leave at room temperature
What it should look like NOW: [PHOTO: Just-mixed starter - looks like thick pancake batter, no bubbles yet]
* Consistency of thick pancake batter
* Tan/beige color
* No bubbles yet - that's normal
What it should look like in 4-6 hours: [PHOTO: Active, peaked starter - domed top, lots of bubbles]
* Doubled in size
* Domed top
* Bubbles all over the surface
* Smells fresh and tangy
Set a timer for 6 hours from now (3:00 PM) to mix your dough.
________________


STEP 2: MIX YOUR DOUGH
Friday, 3:00 PM | Active time: 10 minutes
Before you start: Make sure your starter is at peak (domed, bubbly, passes float test). If it's not ready yet, wait another hour.
What you're doing: Combining all ingredients into a shaggy dough.
How to do it:
1. In a large bowl, combine:
   * 300g active starter
   * 350g water (room temperature)
2. Stir together with your hand or a spoon
3. Add:
   * 500g bread flour
   * 10g salt
4. Mix with your hands until no dry flour remains
5. Dough will be shaggy and rough - that's perfect
What it should look like: [PHOTO: Just-mixed dough - shaggy, rough, all flour incorporated]
* Rough and shaggy
* No dry flour anywhere
* Sticky to the touch
* Doesn't look "like dough" yet - that's normal!
Don't worry about gluten development yet. That comes next.
Cover the bowl. Set a timer for 30 minutes.
________________


STEP 3: DEVELOP GLUTEN (STRETCH & FOLD METHOD)
Friday, 3:30 PM - 5:10 PM | Active time: 2 minutes per fold, 4 folds total
What you're doing: Building gluten structure through a series of gentle folds.
How to do one set of folds:
1. Wet your hand (so dough doesn't stick)
2. Grab the dough from one side of the bowl
3. Stretch it up (gently!) about 6-8 inches
4. Fold it over to the center of the dough
5. Rotate bowl 90 degrees
6. Repeat 3 more times (one on each "side")
7. Flip dough over so smooth side is up
8. Cover bowl
[PHOTO SEQUENCE: Four photos showing grab, stretch, fold, rotate motion]
You'll do this 4 times, spaced 30 minutes apart:
* 3:30 PM - Fold #1
* 4:00 PM - Fold #2
* 4:30 PM - Fold #3
* 5:00 PM - Fold #4
What you should notice:
After Fold #1: [PHOTO: Dough after first fold - still rough, but slightly smoother]
* Dough is still pretty rough
* Starts to feel slightly smoother
After Fold #2: [PHOTO: Dough getting smoother, more cohesive]
* Dough is smoother
* Holds together better
* You might see some bubbles forming
After Fold #3: [PHOTO: Dough looking smooth, bubbles visible]
* Noticeably smoother surface
* More bubbles visible
* Dough has more structure
After Fold #4: DO THE WINDOWPANE TEST [PHOTO: Windowpane test - thin translucent membrane of dough]
Take a small piece of dough. Gently stretch it between your fingers. Can you stretch it thin enough to see light through it without it tearing?
✓ YES - Passes: You see a thin, translucent membrane → Gluten is developed!
✗ NO - Fails: It tears before getting translucent → Do one more fold in 30 minutes, test again
Once you pass the windowpane test, cover the bowl and let the dough begin bulk fermentation undisturbed.
________________


STEP 4: BULK FERMENTATION
Friday, 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM | Active time: 0 minutes (just watching)
What you're doing: Letting the yeast ferment the dough, create gas, and develop flavor.
How to do it:
1. Cover the bowl
2. Place it in a warm spot (70-75°F is ideal)
3. Leave it alone
4. Check it after 3 hours
What to look for at the 3-hour mark (8:00 PM):
✓ READY TO SHAPE when you see ALL of these: [PHOTO: Properly fermented dough - risen 50-75%, bubbly, jiggly]
* Dough has risen 50-75% in volume (NOT doubled - that's too much)
* Surface is domed and bubbly
* Dough jiggles when you move the bowl
* You can see bubbles through the side of the bowl (if it's glass)
DO THE POKE TEST: [PHOTO: Finger poking dough, dough slowly springs halfway back]
* Flour your finger
* Poke the dough ½ inch deep
* Watch what happens:
   * Springs back slowly, leaves slight indent → ✓ READY
   * Springs back fast → Not ready yet, wait 30-60 min, test again
   * Doesn't spring back → Overproofed, shape it anyway
If your kitchen is cooler (65-68°F), this might take 4-5 hours. If warmer (78-80°F), might only take 3-4 hours. Watch the dough, not just the clock.
________________


STEP 5: SHAPE THE DOUGH
Friday, 8:00 PM | Active time: 5 minutes
What you're doing: Creating surface tension so your loaf holds its shape and rises up instead of spreading out.
How to do it:
Part A: Pre-shape
1. Lightly flour your work surface
2. Gently turn dough out of bowl onto surface (use bench scraper to help)
3. Fold the edges toward the center, working around in a circle
4. You're creating a rough round shape
[PHOTO: Dough turned out, folding edges to center]
5. Let it rest for 15 minutes (covered with a towel)
Part B: Final shape (Boule)
1. Lightly flour the top of the dough
2. Flip it over so the seam side (rough side) is down
3. Cup your hands around the dough
4. Using the friction between dough and counter, drag the dough toward you in small circular motions
5. Rotate and repeat
6. You're creating tension on the surface
[PHOTO SEQUENCE: Cupping dough, dragging toward you, rotating, final shaped boule with tight surface]
What it should look like: [PHOTO: Final shaped boule - smooth, taut surface]
* Smooth, taut surface
* Round shape
* Holds its form (doesn't immediately spread)
Part C: Into the banneton
1. Flour your banneton (or flour-lined bowl) HEAVILY
2. Pick up the dough with your bench scraper
3. Place it in the banneton seam-side UP (smooth side down)
4. Cover with a plastic bag or bowl cover
[PHOTO: Dough in banneton, seam side up]
Into the fridge it goes!
________________


STEP 6: COLD PROOF (OVERNIGHT)
Friday, 8:05 PM - Saturday, 9:00 AM | Active time: 0 minutes
What you're doing: Final fermentation in the fridge. This develops flavor and makes the dough easier to score.
How to do it:
1. Place covered banneton in refrigerator
2. Walk away
3. Go to bed
4. Sleep soundly knowing your dough is slowly getting more delicious
Timing flexibility:
* Minimum: 12 hours (mild flavor)
* Sweet spot: 18-24 hours (good flavor, great oven spring)
* Maximum: 48 hours (very tangy)
For this bake, we're going 13 hours (8 PM to 9 AM).
________________


STEP 7: PREHEAT OVEN
Saturday, 8:00 AM | Active time: 2 minutes
What you're doing: Getting your oven and Dutch oven screaming hot.
How to do it:
1. Place Dutch oven with lid in your oven
2. Set oven to 450°F
3. Let it preheat for a full hour
4. Don't rush this - you want that Dutch oven fully heated through
Why this matters:
* Hot Dutch oven = instant oven spring
* It creates a mini steam environment
* The thermal mass holds heat even when you open to load bread
Set a timer for 1 hour.
________________


STEP 8: SCORE & LOAD
Saturday, 9:00 AM | Active time: 5 minutes
What you're doing: Scoring the dough (giving it a place to expand) and loading it into the hot Dutch oven.
How to do it:
Part A: Score the dough
1. Remove banneton from fridge
2. Cut a piece of parchment paper, place on counter
3. Flip banneton over onto parchment (dough is now smooth-side up)
4. Optional: Dust top lightly with flour for contrast
[PHOTO: Dough on parchment, smooth side up]
5. Using a lame or sharp knife, make one decisive cut:
   * Hold blade at 30-45 degree angle
   * Make a swift, confident cut about ½ inch deep
   * 4-5 inches long across the top
[PHOTO: Scoring the dough at an angle]
Simple beginner score: One long slash across the top. That's it.
Part B: Load into Dutch oven
1. Carefully remove hot Dutch oven from oven (use oven mitts!)
2. Remove lid
3. Using the parchment as a sling, lower dough into Dutch oven
4. Put lid back on
5. Place back in oven
[PHOTO: Lowering dough into Dutch oven using parchment]
CLOSE THE OVEN IMMEDIATELY
________________


STEP 9: BAKE
Saturday, 9:00 AM - 9:45 AM | Active time: 0 minutes
What you're doing: The oven is doing all the work now.
How to do it:
Phase 1: Covered (20 minutes)
* Bake with lid ON for 20 minutes
* This traps steam, helps with oven spring
* DO NOT open the oven
Phase 2: Uncovered (20-25 minutes)
* After 20 minutes, remove lid
* Continue baking for another 20-25 minutes
* Bread should be deeply golden brown
* Internal temperature should be at least 200°F
[PHOTO: Bread after 20 minutes with lid on - pale, risen] [PHOTO: Bread after full bake - deep golden brown crust]
What you'll see:
* At 20 minutes: Bread is pale, has risen dramatically (oven spring!)
* At 40-45 minutes: Deep golden-brown crust, sounds hollow when tapped
Remove from oven. Turn out of Dutch oven onto a cooling rack.
________________


STEP 10: COOL & SLICE
Saturday, 9:45 AM - 11:00+ AM | Active time: 0 minutes (but hardest step!)
What you're doing: Letting the bread finish cooking inside and the crumb set up.
How to do it:
1. Place bread on cooling rack
2. Walk away
3. DO NOT SLICE IT YET
Wait at least 1 hour. Preferably 2 hours.
[PHOTO: Beautiful golden loaf on cooling rack]
Why you have to wait:
* The inside is still cooking from residual heat
* Steam is still redistributing inside
* If you cut it too soon, the crumb will be gummy
After 1-2 hours: [PHOTO: Perfect slice showing open, airy crumb]
NOW you can slice it.
You did it. You made sourdough bread.

PAGE 1: CREATING & MAINTAINING YOUR STARTER
Your Sourdough Starter: Care & Feeding
Every loaf begins with a healthy, active starter. Here's everything you need to know.
________________


WHAT IS A SOURDOUGH STARTER?
A sourdough starter is a live culture of wild yeast and beneficial bacteria living in a mixture of flour and water. Think of it as a pet that:
* Needs regular feeding
* Lives in your kitchen
* Makes delicious bread possible
What's in there?
* Wild yeast: Makes the dough rise (produces CO₂)
* Lactic acid bacteria: Creates tangy flavor and helps preserve the bread
* Flour and water: Food for the yeast and bacteria
Your starter is alive. Treat it well, feed it regularly, and it will work for you for years—even decades.
________________


YOU ALREADY HAVE A STARTER
The starter you received from class is:
* Active and healthy
* The same culture we use at SLO Food Market
* Ready to use or ready to store
Your job now is to keep it alive and happy.
________________


BASIC FEEDING INSTRUCTIONS
What "feeding" means: You're giving your starter fresh flour and water so the yeast and bacteria have food to eat. When they eat, they multiply and stay strong.
The basic ratio: 1:1:1
* 1 part starter
* 1 part flour (by weight)
* 1 part water (by weight)
Example:
* 50g starter
* 50g all-purpose flour
* 50g water (room temperature)
How to feed:
1. Discard most of your starter, keeping only the amount you need (usually 50g)
2. Add fresh flour and water in equal parts
3. Stir until fully combined (no dry flour)
4. Cover loosely (not airtight—it needs to breathe)
5. Wait for it to peak (4-6 hours at room temp)
________________


WHY DO I HAVE TO DISCARD?
If you didn't discard, you'd be adding more and more flour and water each feeding. Within a week you'd have gallons of starter.
Discarding keeps the ratio balanced so your starter stays vigorous and healthy.
What to do with discard:
* Compost it
* Use it in pancakes, waffles, crackers, muffins (search "sourdough discard recipes")
* Give it to a friend who wants to start baking
Note: The "discard" isn't bad or dead—it's just excess. It can still be used for baking non-yeasted goods.
________________


TWO WAYS TO MAINTAIN YOUR STARTER
________________


OPTION 1: ROOM TEMPERATURE (For frequent bakers)
Best for: Baking 2-3+ times per week
How to maintain:
* Keep starter on your counter
* Feed once or twice daily
* Use 1:1:1 ratio
Feeding schedule:
* Once daily: Feed every 24 hours (same time each day)
* Twice daily: Feed every 12 hours (morning and night)
When to use this method: If you're baking multiple times a week, keeping your starter at room temperature means it's always ready to use. Just take what you need for your recipe and feed the remainder.
Temperature matters:
* Warm kitchen (75-80°F): Feed twice daily
* Cool kitchen (65-70°F): Once daily is fine
________________


OPTION 2: REFRIGERATOR (For occasional bakers)
Best for: Baking once a week or less
How to maintain:
1. Feed your starter (1:1:1 or 1:5:5)
2. Let it sit at room temp for 1-2 hours (so it "wakes up" and starts fermenting)
3. Cover and put it in the fridge
4. Feed once a week
When you want to bake:
1. Remove from fridge the night before (or 12-16 hours before you need it)
2. Feed it (1:1:1)
3. Leave at room temperature until doubled and bubbly (4-8 hours)
4. Use what you need for your recipe
5. Feed the remainder and put it back in the fridge
This is our recommended method for beginners. It's low-maintenance and gives you flexibility.
________________


FEEDING RATIOS EXPLAINED
The ratio you use determines how fast your starter will peak.
1:1:1 (Quick feeding)
* Example: 50g starter + 50g flour + 50g water = 150g total
* Peaks in: 4-6 hours (room temp, 70-75°F)
* Use when: You want to bake same day or next day
1:5:5 (Slow feeding)
* Example: 20g starter + 100g flour + 100g water = 220g total
* Peaks in: 8-12 hours (room temp)
* Use when: You want it ready in the morning, or you're going into the fridge
1:10:10 (Very slow feeding)
* Example: 10g starter + 100g flour + 100g water = 210g total
* Peaks in: 12-18 hours (room temp)
* Use when: Long cold storage, or you want maximum flexibility
More food (higher ratio) = slower fermentation
________________


WATER TEMPERATURE MATTERS
Room temperature water (65-75°F): Standard for most feedings
Warm water (80-90°F): Speeds up fermentation
* Use in winter or cold kitchens
* Use when you want starter ready faster
Cool water (50-60°F): Slows down fermentation
* Use in summer or hot kitchens
* Use before refrigerating
Never use hot water (over 95°F) - you'll kill the yeast
________________


WHAT FLOUR TO USE FOR FEEDING
All-Purpose Flour: Totally fine, economical, our recommendation for regular feedings
Bread Flour: Also works great, slightly higher protein
Whole Wheat or Rye: Makes a more active, vigorous starter but ferments faster and can taste more sour
Our recommendation: Feed with all-purpose flour. It's cheaper, consistent, and works beautifully.
You can bake with bread flour even if you feed with AP flour. The starter adapts.

Learn to read your starter at a glance
________________


[This page would be laid out with three large photos side-by-side across the page, each taking up about 1/3 of the width]
________________


❌ NOT READY: Underfed / Sluggish Starter
[LARGE PHOTO: Starter in jar, flat or only slightly risen, few bubbles, looks dense]
What you see:
* ☐ Little to no rise since last feeding
* ☐ Few bubbles on surface (or none)
* ☐ Dense, thick consistency
* ☐ May have a layer of liquid on top (hooch)
What you smell:
* Strong sour smell
* Acetone or nail-polish-remover smell
* Not fresh or yeasty
Float test result:
* ❌ SINKS immediately
What this means: The yeast has eaten all available food and is starving. The bacteria are dominating, creating too much acid.
What to do:
* Feed it again
* Wait for it to peak (4-6 hours)
* Test again before using
This starter will NOT make good bread right now.
________________


⚠️ GETTING THERE: Needs Feeding Soon
[LARGE PHOTO: Starter with some rise, some bubbles, may have hooch on top]
What you see:
* ☐ Some rise (maybe 50%)
* ☐ Some bubbles, but not many
* ☐ May have liquid (hooch) on top
* ☐ Top may be starting to flatten
What you smell:
* Sour smell
* Not as fresh as you want
Float test result:
* ⚠️ May float, may not - inconsistent
What this means: Your starter peaked hours ago and is starting to decline. It's hungry. If you stored it in the fridge, this is totally normal.
What to do:
* If just fed: Wait longer (it hasn't peaked yet)
* If hours since feeding: Feed it again, wait for peak
* If from fridge: Feed it, let it come to room temp, wait for peak
Can you use it? Maybe, but you'll get better results if you wait for peak activity.
________________


✓ READY: Peak Activity - BAKE NOW!
[LARGE PHOTO: Starter in jar, doubled in size, domed top, lots of bubbles all over surface]
What you see:
* ☐ DOUBLED in size (or close to it)
* ☐ DOMED top (not flat, not collapsed)
* ☐ BUBBLES all over the surface
* ☐ Airy and light appearance
* ☐ May have small "rivulets" or streams of fine bubbles
What you smell:
* Fresh, tangy smell
* Yeasty aroma
* Pleasant - you'd want to bake with it
Float test result:
* ✅ FLOATS easily on water
What this means: The yeast is at maximum activity. There's plenty of food, plenty of gas production, plenty of acidity for flavor. This starter is STRONG and will make your dough rise beautifully.
What to do: USE IT NOW (or within the next 1-2 hours)
This is what you're aiming for every time.

* Keep starter in a jar on your counter
* Feed once daily at the same time
* Always keep at least 50g starter after discarding
Daily routine:
1. Morning: Discard down to 50g
2. Add 50g flour + 50g water
3. Stir, cover loosely
4. Starter peaks 4-6 hours later
5. Use anytime after peak (within 6-8 hours)
6. Repeat tomorrow
When you bake:
* Take what your recipe needs (usually 300-500g)
* Feed the remaining 50g as usual
* Continue your daily routine
________________


SCHEDULE 2: WEEKLY FRIDGE STORAGE (Weekend Baker)
For: Baking once a week
Weekly maintenance:
1. Once a week (e.g., every Sunday):
   * Remove from fridge
   * Discard down to 20g
   * Feed with 100g flour + 100g water (1:5:5 ratio)
   * Let sit at room temp for 1-2 hours
   * Put back in fridge
When you want to bake:
1. Night before baking (or 12-16 hours before):
   * Remove from fridge
   * Discard down to 50g
   * Feed with 50g flour + 50g water
   * Leave at room temp
   * Wait for peak (4-8 hours - may take longer if cold)
2. When peaked:
   * Build to amount needed for recipe (see Section 7)
   * Use in your dough
3. After baking:
   * Feed remaining starter (1:5:5)
   * Let sit 1-2 hours
   * Back in fridge
________________


SCHEDULE 3: MONTHLY FRIDGE STORAGE (Occasional Baker)
For: Baking 1-2 times per month
Maintenance:
* Feed every 1-2 weeks minimum
* Use 1:10:10 ratio
* Can go up to 2 weeks without feeding (but not longer)
When you want to bake:
1. Two nights before baking:
   * Remove from fridge
   * Feed (1:1:1)
   * Let come to room temp overnight
2. Next morning:
   * Check if it doubled/peaked
   * If yes: Feed again, use this feeding for your bake
   * If no: Feed again, wait for peak, then feed once more
3. Use the second active feeding for your bread
4. After baking: Feed remainder, back to fridge
Note: Neglected starters take 2-3 feedings to "wake up" and become vigorous again.
________________


SCHEDULE 4: BUILDING STARTER FOR A RECIPE
When: The night before you want to mix dough
If your starter is in the fridge:
1. 12-16 hours before mixing dough:
   * Calculate how much ripe starter your recipe needs (e.g., 300g)
   * Use this formula:
      * Take 10% of recipe amount (30g) = starter to feed
      * Add 45% as flour (135g)
      * Add 45% as water (135g)
      * Total = 300g ripe starter
2. Mix thoroughly, cover, leave at room temp
3. Wait 12-16 hours until doubled and bubbly
4. Use in your recipe
If your starter is on the counter:
* Same process, but it will peak faster (4-6 hours)
[See Page 7 of this binder for the complete formula and examples for each recipe]

Common Starter Problems & Solutions
________________


Q: Is my starter dead?
Probably not. Starters are incredibly resilient.
Signs your starter is still alive:
* Any bubbles at all (even tiny ones)
* Any rise after feeding (even just 10-20%)
* Sour smell (not moldy smell)
Signs your starter might actually be dead:
* Mold (fuzzy growth, pink/orange/black spots)
* No activity whatsoever after 3-4 feedings
* Putrid smell (like rotting garbage, not just sour)
What to do:
1. If there's mold → Discard it, start over
2. If no mold but sluggish → Feed it daily for 3-5 days, it will revive
3. If truly dead → Contact us for a new starter
Bottom line: If you see any bubbles at all, it's alive. Keep feeding it.
________________


Q: What is this liquid on top?
That's "hooch." It's alcohol produced by fermentation.
What it means: Your starter is hungry. It's eaten all available food and is now sitting in its own waste products (alcohol).
What to do:
* Option 1: Pour it off, then feed your starter
* Option 2: Stir it back in, then feed your starter
   * Stirring it in makes your starter slightly more sour
   * Pouring it off keeps it milder
Is it bad? No. It's just a sign to feed your starter more often or use a larger feeding ratio.
Color: Hooch can be clear, gray, or even dark brown. All normal.
________________


Q: My starter smells like nail polish remover (acetone)
This is normal for a hungry starter.
Why it happens: When the starter runs out of food, the bacteria produce acetic acid (vinegar smell) and acetone. It's a stress response.
What to do:
1. Feed your starter
2. If on the counter: Feed more frequently (twice daily instead of once)
3. If in fridge: Feed with a higher ratio (1:5:5 or 1:10:10)
Will it affect my bread? If you use it when it smells like this, your bread will be very sour and the rise might be weak. Better to feed it and wait for it to peak.
________________


Q: My starter isn't rising much after feeding
Possible causes:
1. Water too hot
* Killed the yeast
* Solution: Use room temp or lukewarm water (never over 90°F)
2. Too cold
* Fermentation is very slow
* Solution: Move to a warmer spot, wait longer (8-12 hours)
3. Needs more feedings
* If it's been in the fridge for weeks, it's sluggish
* Solution: Feed daily for 3-5 days to wake it up
4. Chlorine in tap water
* Some municipal water has lots of chlorine
* Solution: Let water sit out overnight before using, or use filtered water
5. Not enough time
* You're checking too soon
* Solution: Wait longer - it might take 8-12 hours in a cool kitchen
________________


Q: Can I use whole wheat flour instead of white flour?
Yes! Whole wheat makes a very active, vigorous starter.
Things to know:
* Whole wheat ferments faster (more nutrients for yeast)
* Your starter will be thicker
* It will taste more sour
* It will smell stronger
Our recommendation:
* Feed with whole wheat if you want to
* Or do a 50/50 mix (half whole wheat, half all-purpose)
* You can switch back and forth - the starter adapts
________________


Q: My starter has separated into layers
Totally normal if it's been sitting for a while.
What you see:
* Liquid on top (hooch)
* Thick paste in the middle
* Maybe some liquid at the bottom
What to do:
* Stir it all together
* Feed it
* It will come back together
________________


Q: Can I freeze my starter?
Yes, but refrigeration is easier for regular storage.
When to freeze:
* Going on vacation for weeks/months
* Want a backup in case something happens to your main starter
* Want to give starter to a friend later
How to freeze:
1. Feed your starter, let it peak
2. Spread a thin layer on parchment paper
3. Let it dry completely (1-2 days)
4. Break into flakes, store in airtight container or freezer bag
5. Freeze
How to revive:
1. Take a tablespoon of dried starter flakes
2. Add 50g water, let it dissolve (a few hours)
3. Add 50g flour, mix
4. Feed daily for 3-5 days until vigorous
Easier method: Just refrigerate and feed weekly.
________________


Q: I forgot to feed my starter for [X weeks]. Is it okay?
Probably yes.
Up to 2 weeks: Almost certainly fine. Feed it, wait for it to peak, feed it again. Should be good.
2-4 weeks: Likely fine. May need 3-4 feedings to wake up fully.
1-2 months: Might still be alive. Check for mold first. If no mold, try feeding it daily for a week.
3+ months: May or may not survive. Worth trying to revive, but you may need a fresh starter.
The record: People have revived starters left in the fridge for a year. Starters are tough.
________________


Q: Should I name my starter?
Absolutely. This is scientifically proven to make better bread.*
Popular names:
* Doughy McDoughface
* Bread Pitt
* Gluten Tag
* The Yeast Beast
* Bubbles
What did you name yours? ___________________
________________


*Not scientifically proven.
________________


Q: Can I give my starter to a friend?
Yes! Sharing is encouraged.
How to share:
1. When your starter is at peak activity, scoop some into a small jar
2. Give your friend:
   * About 50g of active starter
   * Feeding instructions (or a copy of this binder!)
   * A jar to keep it in
3. They should feed it as soon as they get home
Your starter is now immortal - living in multiple kitchens.

SECTION 5: MIXING & GLUTEN DEVELOPMENT
SECTION 5: MIXING & GLUTEN DEVELOPMENT
Color: Orange tab
________________


PAGE 1: UNDERSTANDING GLUTEN
What Is Gluten and Why Does It Matter?
The foundation of great bread is strong gluten. Here's what you need to know.
________________


WHAT IS GLUTEN?
Gluten is a network of proteins that forms when you mix flour and water together and then work the dough.
Think of it like this:
* Flour contains two main proteins: glutenin and gliadin
* When you add water, these proteins start linking together
* When you knead, fold, or stretch the dough, they form long chains
* These chains tangle and cross-link, creating a web or net
* This web is gluten
________________


WHY GLUTEN MATTERS
Gluten does three critical jobs in your bread:
1. TRAPS GAS [Small illustration: Gluten strands forming a net with CO₂ bubbles trapped inside]
The yeast in your starter produces carbon dioxide (CO₂). Gluten traps that gas in tiny pockets throughout the dough. Without gluten, the gas escapes and your dough stays flat.
Strong gluten = Gas stays trapped = Bread rises
________________


2. GIVES STRUCTURE [Small illustration: Side-by-side comparison of weak vs. strong dough structure]
Gluten is what allows your dough to hold its shape. It gives the dough elasticity (springs back) and extensibility (stretches without tearing).
Good gluten development = Dough holds shape = Tall loaf Poor gluten development = Dough spreads out = Flat loaf
________________


3. CREATES TEXTURE
Gluten determines the texture of your crumb:
* Well-developed gluten = Open, airy crumb with irregular holes
* Underdeveloped gluten = Dense, tight crumb
* That chewy texture you love in good bread? That's gluten.
________________


MIXING vs. DEVELOPING
These are NOT the same thing.
________________


MIXING = Combining ingredients
* Takes 1-2 minutes
* Goal: Get all flour hydrated, no dry spots
* Dough is rough and shaggy
* This is just the starting point
[Photo: Just-mixed dough - shaggy, rough, barely holding together]
________________


DEVELOPING = Building gluten structure
* Takes 10 minutes (active kneading) OR several hours (with periodic folds)
* Goal: Create strong gluten network
* Dough becomes smooth, elastic, cohesive
* This is what makes bread possible
[Photo: Fully developed dough - smooth, elastic, bounces back when poked]
________________


HOW GLUTEN DEVELOPS
Gluten develops through:
1. Hydration When flour meets water, the proteins start to unwind and align. This is why we let dough rest after mixing (autolyse).
2. Mechanical action Kneading, folding, stretching - any movement that aligns and tangles the protein chains.
3. Time Even without touching it, gluten develops slowly over time during fermentation. The dough moves and stretches itself as gas builds up inside.
________________


THE THREE STAGES OF GLUTEN DEVELOPMENT
STAGE 1: Undermixed
* Shaggy, rough texture
* Tears easily when stretched
* No elasticity
→ Bread will be dense, won't hold shape
________________


STAGE 2: Partial Development
* Smoother but still some rough spots
* Stretches a bit before tearing
* Some elasticity
→ Bread will be okay but not optimal
________________


STAGE 3: Full Development
* Smooth, cohesive dough
* Stretches thin without tearing
* Strong elasticity and structure
→ Bread will have great rise and texture
________________


HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DONE?
The Windowpane Test
This is your #1 tool for checking gluten development. It's simple, fast, and never lies.
We'll show you exactly how to do it on the next page.
________________


KEY TAKEAWAYS
✓ Gluten = protein network that traps gas and gives structure
✓ Mixing ≠ Developing (mixing is fast, development takes time and work)
✓ You need FULL gluten development for good sourdough
✓ The windowpane test tells you when you're done
________________


PAGE 2: THE WINDOWPANE TEST - YOUR BEST TOOL
Master This Test, Master Your Dough
________________


WHAT IS THE WINDOWPANE TEST?
The windowpane test tells you if your gluten is fully developed by checking if you can stretch the dough thin enough to see light through it—like a windowpane.
If you can make a thin, translucent membrane → Gluten is developed ✓ If it tears before getting thin → Keep working the dough ✗
It's that simple.
________________


HOW TO PERFORM THE TEST
Step 1: Take a small piece of dough (golf ball size)
Step 2: Wet your hands slightly (so dough doesn't stick)
Step 3: Gently stretch the dough between your fingers and thumbs
Step 4: Keep stretching slowly and carefully, making it thinner and thinner
Step 5: Hold it up to the light
________________


VISUAL GUIDE: THREE OUTCOMES
________________


[This would be laid out as three large photos across the page]
________________


❌ FAIL: Undermixed
[PHOTO: Dough being stretched, tears immediately, thick and rough]
What you see:
* Dough tears as soon as you start stretching
* Can barely stretch it at all
* Texture is rough and shaggy
* No translucency - it's thick and opaque
What this means: Gluten network hasn't formed yet. Proteins haven't linked together.
What to do:
* Keep folding/kneading
* Test again in 30 minutes (if using stretch & fold method)
* Test again in 3-5 minutes (if kneading actively)
________________


⚠️ PARTIAL: Getting There
[PHOTO: Dough stretched thin-ish but tearing before truly translucent]
What you see:
* Dough stretches more than before
* Gets somewhat thin
* But tears before you can see light through it clearly
* Some areas might be translucent, others tear
What this means: Gluten is forming but not complete. You're halfway there.
What to do:
* Keep working the dough
* Test again in 30 minutes (stretch & fold)
* Test again in 2-3 minutes (active kneading)
________________


✓ PASS: Fully Developed
[PHOTO: Dough stretched very thin, light clearly visible through it, translucent membrane]
What you see:
* Dough stretches VERY thin
* You can see light through it
* It looks like a translucent membrane or windowpane
* Doesn't tear even when stretched this thin
* Might see faint lines (that's the gluten strands - good!)
What this means: Gluten network is fully formed. Strong protein chains are aligned and cross-linked throughout the dough.
What to do: ✓ STOP MIXING. Your dough is ready for bulk fermentation.
________________


TECHNIQUE TIPS
Be gentle: Don't force it. Stretch slowly and carefully. You're testing the dough's strength, not trying to rip it apart.
Use enough dough: A piece too small is hard to stretch properly. Golf ball size is about right.
Wet your hands: Keeps dough from sticking to your fingers so you can stretch it properly.
Look for the overall structure: A few small tears are okay. What matters is whether the dough can form a thin membrane overall.
________________


WHEN TO TEST
Using stretch & fold method:
* Test after your 3rd or 4th fold
* If it fails, do another fold and test again in 30 minutes
Using active kneading:
* Test after 5 minutes of kneading
* If it fails, knead another 3-5 minutes and test again
Using a stand mixer:
* Test after 3-4 minutes on low speed
* If it fails, mix another 2 minutes and test again
________________


COMMON QUESTIONS
Q: What if it passes in some spots but tears in others? A: Keep working it. You want consistent strength throughout.
Q: Can I overdo it? A: With hand mixing, almost impossible. With a stand mixer, yes - if you mix too long (10+ minutes) the dough can break down.
Q: My dough is really wet and sticky - can I still test? A: Yes! High-hydration doughs are stickier but should still pass the test. Wet your hands more.
Q: Does whole wheat dough pass the windowpane test? A: Sort of. Whole wheat has bran that cuts gluten strands, so it won't be as translucent. But you should still see good stretch and structure.
________________


THIS TEST IS YOUR FRIEND
Forget watching the clock.
Forget counting folds.
Do the windowpane test.
It tells you exactly when your dough is ready, every single time, regardless of temperature, humidity, flour type, or anything else.
Master this test, and you'll never wonder "is my dough mixed enough?" again.

PAGE 3: MIXING METHODS
Four Ways to Develop Gluten
Choose the method that fits your style and schedule
________________


METHOD 1: STRETCH & FOLD ⭐ RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS
Best for: Hands-off approach, high-hydration doughs, beginners
Time required: 3-4 sets of folds over 2-3 hours
Effort level: Very low - about 2 minutes every 30 minutes
________________


HOW IT WORKS:
Instead of kneading continuously, you do short bursts of gentle folding over several hours. Time and fermentation do most of the gluten development for you.
________________


STEP-BY-STEP:
[Four sequential photos showing the folding motion]
1. Wet your hand (so dough doesn't stick)
2. Grab one edge of the dough from the side of the bowl
3. Stretch it up gently (about 6-8 inches) and fold it over to the center
4. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat
5. Do this 4 times (once on each "side" of the dough)
6. Flip the dough over so the smooth side is facing up
7. Cover the bowl and wait 30 minutes
8. Repeat - Do 3-4 total sets of folds
________________


SCHEDULE:
3:00 PM - Mix dough (shaggy, rough)
3:30 PM - Fold set #1
4:00 PM - Fold set #2
4:30 PM - Fold set #3
5:00 PM - Fold set #4 (should pass windowpane test)
5:00 PM onwards - Bulk fermentation (no more folds)


________________


WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE:
* After fold #1: Dough is still rough but slightly smoother
* After fold #2: Dough is more cohesive, some bubbles visible
* After fold #3: Dough is smooth, elastic, holds together well
* After fold #4: Dough is strong, bouncy, passes windowpane test
________________


WHY WE RECOMMEND THIS:
✓ Gentle on the dough - preserves air bubbles
✓ Easy - no continuous effort required
✓ Works great for wet, sticky doughs
✓ You can do other things between folds
✓ Hard to mess up
________________


METHOD 2: SLAP & FOLD (FRENCH KNEADING)
Best for: Fast gluten development, when you want to be done quickly
Time required: 5-8 minutes of continuous work
Effort level: Medium-high - it's a workout
________________


HOW IT WORKS:
You pick up the dough, slap it on the counter, fold it over itself, and repeat rapidly. The force and motion develop gluten quickly.
________________


STEP-BY-STEP:
[Four sequential photos showing the slap and fold motion]
1. Scrape dough onto clean counter (no flour)
2. Scoop dough up with both hands from underneath
3. Lift it up to waist height
4. Slap it down on the counter (let the far edge hit first)
5. Use momentum to fold the near edge over the top
6. Rotate 90 degrees
7. Repeat rapidly for 5-8 minutes
8. Stop when dough is smooth and passes windowpane test
________________


WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE:
* First 2 minutes: Dough is sticky, messy, wants to stick to your hands
* 3-4 minutes: Dough starts to smooth out, becomes more cohesive
* 5-8 minutes: Dough is smooth, elastic, stops sticking, bounces back
________________


TIPS:
* Keep your hands slightly wet
* Work on a clean counter (no flour - you want friction)
* Don't worry if it's messy at first - it will come together
* Use a bench scraper to clean up between rounds
________________


WHY USE THIS:
✓ Fast - done in under 10 minutes
✓ Satisfying - you can feel the dough transform
✓ Great workout
Why NOT to use this:
✗ Messy, especially at first
✗ Tiring on your arms
✗ Can be intimidating for beginners
________________


METHOD 3: COIL FOLDS
Best for: Very wet doughs, gentle handling, preserving structure
Time required: 3-4 sets over 2-3 hours
Effort level: Very low
________________


HOW IT WORKS:
Similar to stretch & fold, but even gentler. You lift the dough from the center and let the edges fold under themselves.
________________


STEP-BY-STEP:
[Four sequential photos showing coil fold motion]
1. Wet both hands
2. Slide both hands under the center of the dough
3. Lift straight up - the dough stretches and the ends fall down
4. Let the ends "coil" underneath as you lower the dough back down
5. Rotate bowl 90 degrees
6. Repeat (lift, coil under, rotate)
7. Do this twice (so dough is coiled on all four sides)
8. Cover and wait 30 minutes
9. Repeat - Do 3-4 total sets
________________


WHY USE THIS:
✓ Extremely gentle - great for very open crumb
✓ Works with sticky, wet doughs
✓ Doesn't deflate the dough at all
When to use: When your dough is 75%+ hydration (very wet) or when you want maximum airiness.
________________


METHOD 4: TRADITIONAL KNEADING
Best for: Lower hydration doughs, if you like a classic approach
Time required: 8-12 minutes of continuous kneading
Effort level: High - it's physical work
________________


HOW IT WORKS:
The classic bread-kneading method. Push, fold, turn, repeat.
________________


STEP-BY-STEP:
[Four photos showing kneading motion]
1. Place dough on lightly floured counter
2. Push dough away from you with the heels of your hands
3. Fold the dough back over itself
4. Rotate 90 degrees
5. Repeat continuously for 8-12 minutes
6. Test with windowpane - keep going until it passes
________________


WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE:
* First 3 minutes: Dough is rough, stiff, fights you
* 5-7 minutes: Dough softens, becomes smoother
* 8-12 minutes: Dough is silky, elastic, bounces back quickly
________________


WHY USE THIS:
✓ Classic, satisfying
✓ Works well for drier doughs
✓ You're in full control
Why NOT to use this:
✗ Tiring
✗ Doesn't work as well for wet sourdough
✗ Takes sustained effort
________________


WHICH METHOD SHOULD YOU USE?
________________


For your first 5-10 loaves: → Stretch & Fold
It's forgiving, effective, and lets you multitask.
________________


Once you're comfortable: → Try Slap & Fold for a faster option
→ Try Coil Folds for very wet doughs
________________


Traditional Kneading: → Use if you're making lower-hydration sandwich bread or if you just love kneading
________________


THE BOTTOM LINE
It doesn't matter which method you use.
What matters is: Does your dough pass the windowpane test?
If yes → Gluten is developed → You're ready to ferment
If no → Keep going → Test again
The method is just a tool. The windowpane test is the goal.

PAGE 4: COMMON MIXING PROBLEMS
Troubleshooting Your Mix
________________


PROBLEM 1: Dough Is Too Sticky
[Photo: Very wet, sticky dough clinging to hands and bowl]
What it looks like:
* Sticks to your hands badly
* More like batter than dough
* Impossible to shape or work with
* Spreads out immediately
Possible causes:
1. Too much water
* You added more water than the recipe called for
* Different flour absorbs different amounts
2. Not enough mixing/gluten development
* Even properly hydrated dough feels sticky before gluten develops
* After development, it should feel less sticky (still tacky, but manageable)
3. Very high hydration recipe
* Some recipes are 75-80% hydration and will always be sticky
* This is normal for those recipes
________________


SOLUTIONS:
If too much water:
* Add flour 10g at a time
* Mix thoroughly between additions
* Stop when dough is workable
If underdeveloped:
* Keep folding/kneading
* Gluten development will make it less sticky
* Don't add flour yet - give it time
If correct for recipe:
* Accept that it's supposed to be sticky
* Keep your hands wet when working with it
* Use a bench scraper to handle it
________________


PROBLEM 2: Dough Is Too Stiff
[Photo: Dry, stiff dough that's hard to work, might have cracks]
What it looks like:
* Hard to mix - feels like it needs more water
* Doesn't stretch - just tears
* Dry looking, might have surface cracks
* Feels tight and resistant
Possible causes:
1. Not enough water
* You measured wrong or didn't add all the water
2. Flour absorbed more water than expected
* Whole wheat flour absorbs more
* Old flour or very dry flour
3. Too much flour
* You added extra while kneading
________________


SOLUTIONS:
Add water gradually:
* Add 10-15g water at a time
* Mix thoroughly
* Let it hydrate for 5 minutes
* Check again
* Repeat if needed
Better approach:
* Mix all ingredients first
* Let rest 15-20 minutes (autolyse)
* THEN decide if it needs more water
* Flour absorbs slowly - give it time
________________


PROBLEM 3: Dough Won't Come Together
[Photo: Shaggy dough that won't form a cohesive mass]
What it looks like:
* Looks like a mess of flour and water
* Won't form a ball
* Dry patches and wet patches
* Feels like something is wrong
Possible causes:
1. Not mixed long enough
* You gave up too soon
2. Flour and water aren't incorporated
* There are still dry pockets
3. Water too cold
* Very cold water slows down hydration
________________


SOLUTIONS:
Keep mixing:
* Use your hands, squeeze the dough
* It WILL come together eventually
* Be patient - this takes a few minutes
Check for dry flour:
* Scrape bottom and sides of bowl
* Mix in any dry flour pockets
Let it rest:
* Stop trying to force it
* Cover it and wait 20 minutes
* Come back - it will be easier to work with
________________


PROBLEM 4: Windowpane Test Never Passes
[Photo: Dough that keeps tearing when stretched]
What it looks like:
* You've been folding/kneading for a long time
* Dough still tears when stretched
* Not getting smoother or stronger
Possible causes:
1. Whole wheat or rye in the recipe
* Bran cuts gluten strands
* Won't get as translucent as white flour
2. Overfermented
* If bulk fermentation started before gluten fully developed
* Acid breaks down gluten
3. Over-mixed (if using stand mixer)
* The gluten broke down from too much mixing
* Dough may look shiny and wet
4. Incorrect flour
* Cake flour, pastry flour = low protein = won't develop strong gluten
________________


SOLUTIONS:
Whole grain dough:
* It won't be as translucent - that's normal
* Look for good stretch and resistance instead of perfect windowpane
Overfermented:
* Shape it and bake it
* Next time, develop gluten BEFORE bulk fermentation gets too far
Over-mixed:
* Shape it and bake it
* Next time, mix less (don't exceed 5-7 min in stand mixer)
Wrong flour:
* Add bread flour to fix this batch
* Buy bread flour for next time
________________


PROBLEM 5: Dough Feels Different Than Expected
You've read recipes, watched videos, but your dough doesn't feel like theirs
THIS IS NORMAL.
Why dough varies:
* Different flour brands absorb water differently
* Humidity affects hydration
* Temperature affects how dough feels
* Your hands are different from the baker in the video
________________


WHAT TO TRUST:
✓ The windowpane test - objective, never lies
✓ Volume increase during bulk - you can see it
✓ Poke test - tactile and reliable
What NOT to trust:
✗ "The dough should feel like an earlobe"
✗ "It should be smooth as a baby's bottom"
✗ "Dough should be tacky but not sticky"
These descriptions are subjective. Everyone's earlobe feels different.
Use objective tests, not feel-good descriptions.
________________


GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING APPROACH
1. Start with the recipe amounts exactly
* Don't adjust on your first try
2. Mix thoroughly
* Ensure all flour is hydrated
3. Let it rest 20 minutes after mixing
* Dough will relax and hydrate fully
4. THEN decide if you need adjustments
* Add water or flour only if truly needed
5. Keep developing gluten until windowpane test passes
* Don't quit early
6. Trust the process
* Your first few doughs might feel weird - that's learning
________________


YOU'LL GET A FEEL FOR IT
By your 3rd or 4th loaf, you'll start to develop intuition for:
* What properly hydrated dough feels like
* How much stretch indicates good gluten
* When the windowpane test will pass
But until then: Follow the recipe, do the tests, trust the process.
Your hands will learn. Give them time.

This section should give students both the theory (why gluten matters) and the practical skills (how to develop it and test it). The windowpane test page is the most critical - that single skill will transform their baking.

PAGE 1: UNDERSTANDING FERMENTATION
What's Happening Inside Your Dough
Fermentation is where the magic happens - and where most beginners get confused
________________


WHAT IS FERMENTATION?
Fermentation is the process where yeast and bacteria in your starter eat the sugars in flour and produce:
Carbon dioxide (CO₂) → Makes dough rise Acids (lactic & acetic) → Creates sour flavor Alcohol & other compounds → Adds complexity and aroma
Think of fermentation as: Your dough slowly inflating like a balloon while developing flavor.
________________


TWO STAGES OF FERMENTATION
________________


STAGE 1: BULK FERMENTATION
When: After mixing and gluten development, before shaping
Where: In a bowl, as one big mass
How long: Usually 4-6 hours at room temperature (varies by temperature)
What's happening:
* Yeast is multiplying and producing CO₂
* Gluten network is trapping that gas
* Dough is expanding and becoming airy
* Flavor is developing
* Acids are building (but also helping structure)
Goal: Get to 50-75% volume increase with good structure and airiness
This is the MOST CRITICAL stage. Get bulk right, and the rest is easy. Get bulk wrong, and your bread will struggle.
________________


STAGE 2: FINAL FERMENTATION (PROOF)
When: After shaping, before baking
Where: In a banneton or bowl, as a shaped loaf
How long:
* Room temp: 2-4 hours
* Cold (fridge): 12-48 hours (our recommendation)
What's happening:
* Final rise of your shaped loaf
* Developing flavor (especially in cold proof)
* Preparing for oven spring
Goal: Dough that's puffy and relaxed, ready to explode with oven spring in the hot oven
________________


BULK VS. PROOF: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
BULK FERMENTATION:
* Happens BEFORE shaping
* Dough is in a mass, still formless
* You want 50-75% rise (NOT doubled - that's too much)
* Most of the flavor development happens here
* Most of the rise happens here
* Timing is critical - this is where beginners mess up
FINAL PROOF:
* Happens AFTER shaping
* Dough is in its final shape
* You want the dough puffy but still with some spring
* Additional flavor, especially if cold proofing
* Less critical timing (cold proof is very forgiving)
________________


WHY BULK FERMENTATION IS CRITICAL
If you undershoot bulk (don't ferment enough):
* Dough is tight and dense
* Won't rise much in oven
* Crumb will be tight, gummy
* Flavor won't be developed
If you nail bulk fermentation:
* Dough is light, airy, full of bubbles
* Will have great oven spring
* Crumb will be open and irregular
* Flavor will be complex and delicious
If you overshoot bulk (ferment too long):
* Dough becomes slack and weak
* Won't hold shape
* Will spread instead of rise
* Might taste TOO sour
* Crumb will be gummy with giant holes and dense spots
The window of "perfect" is about 1-2 hours. You need to learn to recognize it.
________________


THE THREE VARIABLES THAT AFFECT FERMENTATION
1. TEMPERATURE (biggest factor)
* Warmer = Faster fermentation
* Cooler = Slower fermentation
* Every 5°F makes a significant difference
2. STARTER STRENGTH
* Vigorous, active starter = Faster fermentation
* Sluggish starter = Slower fermentation
3. FLOUR TYPE
* Whole grains = Faster fermentation (more food for yeast)
* White flour = Standard fermentation
* Higher protein flour = Can handle longer fermentation
________________


HOW TO KNOW WHEN FERMENTATION IS DONE
Don't rely on time alone. Time is a guideline, but your dough doesn't know what the clock says.
Use your senses:
* ✓ Visual: Volume increase, bubbles, dome
* ✓ Touch: Poke test
* ✓ Movement: Does it jiggle?
We'll teach you exactly what to look for on the next pages.
________________


PAGE 2: BULK FERMENTATION VISUAL GUIDE
The Three Stages: Learn to Recognize Them
This is the most important page in the entire binder
________________


[This page would be laid out with THREE LARGE PHOTOS taking up most of the page, side-by-side-by-side. Each photo shows dough in a clear bowl so you can see volume and bubble structure. These photos are worth more than 1000 words.]
________________


❌ STAGE 1: UNDERFERMENTED - Not Ready Yet
[LARGE PHOTO: Dough in bowl, only risen about 25-30%, few bubbles visible, looks dense]
________________


VISUAL CUES:
Volume:
* Only risen 25-30% (barely at all)
* Doesn't look much bigger than when you started
Surface:
* Relatively flat or slightly domed
* Few bubbles on top (maybe none)
* Looks dense and compact
Through the bowl:
* (If using glass bowl) Few bubbles visible
* Dough looks tight
Movement:
* Doesn't jiggle much when you move the bowl
* Feels firm
________________


POKE TEST: [Small photo: Finger poking dough, dough springs back FAST within 1-2 seconds]
Result: Springs back quickly and completely What it means: Too much tension, not relaxed enough
________________


WHAT'S HAPPENING:
* Yeast hasn't had enough time to produce CO₂
* Not enough gas trapped in gluten network
* Gluten is still tight and hasn't relaxed
________________


WHAT TO DO: → WAIT LONGER
* Check again in 1 hour
* Be patient
If you shape and bake now:
* Bread will be DENSE
* Tight, gummy crumb
* Won't rise much in oven
* Flavor won't be developed
________________


✓ STAGE 2: PROPERLY FERMENTED - Perfect!
[LARGE PHOTO: Dough in bowl, risen 50-75%, domed top, lots of bubbles visible on surface and through bowl, looks airy and alive]
________________


VISUAL CUES:
Volume:
* Risen 50-75% (NOT doubled - that's too far!)
* Noticeably bigger than when started
* Looks puffy and full of air
Surface:
* Clearly domed (not flat)
* Bubbles all over the surface
* Might see some "rivulets" (streams of fine bubbles)
* Surface looks active and alive
Through the bowl:
* (If glass bowl) Can see bubbles throughout
* Mix of small and medium bubbles
* Dough looks airy, not dense
Movement:
* JIGGLES when you move the bowl
* Looks like Jell-O - soft and wobbly
* This jiggle is the best indicator
________________


POKE TEST: [Small photo: Finger poking dough, indent springs back SLOWLY, leaves slight impression]
Result: Springs back slowly (takes 3-5 seconds), comes back about halfway, leaves a slight indent What it means: Perfect balance of structure and relaxation
________________


SMELL:
* Pleasant, tangy aroma
* Slightly acidic but not harsh
* Smells like bread dough should smell
________________


WHAT'S HAPPENING:
* Yeast has produced lots of CO₂
* Gluten has trapped it in thousands of tiny pockets
* Dough has expanded significantly
* Gluten has relaxed enough to be workable
* Perfect balance
________________


WHAT TO DO: → ✓ SHAPE IT NOW
* This is your window
* You have about 1-2 hours before you go past this stage
* Don't wait too long
If you shape and bake now:
* Great oven spring
* Open, airy crumb with irregular holes
* Good flavor, nice tang
* Beautiful bread
________________


❌ STAGE 3: OVERFERMENTED - Too Far
[LARGE PHOTO: Dough in bowl, may have collapsed or flattened, very large irregular bubbles, looks slack and almost wet, might have liquid pooling]
________________


VISUAL CUES:
Volume:
* May have risen high but then started collapsing
* Top is flat or even concave (sunken)
* Might look like it's deflating
Surface:
* Not domed anymore - flat or collapsed
* Very large, irregular bubbles
* May look wet or shiny
* Might have liquid (hooch) pooling
Through the bowl:
* Giant holes mixed with dense areas
* Uneven bubble structure
* Looks broken down
Movement:
* Moves loosely, almost like thick batter
* No structure
________________


POKE TEST: [Small photo: Finger poking dough, indent STAYS, no spring back at all]
Result: Finger goes in, hole stays there, zero spring-back What it means: Gluten has broken down, structure is weak
________________


SMELL:
* Very sour, almost harsh
* Might smell boozy or like strong vinegar
* Alcoholic aroma
* Not pleasant anymore
________________


WHAT'S HAPPENING:
* Yeast has eaten all available food
* Started breaking down the gluten structure
* Excess acid has weakened the dough
* Gas bubbles have merged into huge holes
* Structure is compromised
________________


WHAT TO DO: → Shape it anyway and learn for next time
* It won't be your best loaf, but it's still bakeable
* Don't throw it away
If you bake this:
* Little to no oven spring
* Gummy crumb
* Giant holes mixed with super dense areas
* Very sour flavor (probably too sour)
* Flat loaf that spreads instead of rises
* Still edible, just not great
________________


Next time:
* Check your dough earlier
* Watch for that 50-75% rise
* Trust the poke test
* Don't let it go this far
________________


PAGE 3: THE POKE TEST - YOUR BEST TOOL
Master This Test, Never Guess Again
________________


WHAT IS THE POKE TEST?
The poke test tells you if fermentation is done by showing you how much tension/relaxation is in the dough.
* Too much tension (springs back fast) = underfermented
* Good balance (springs back slowly) = perfect
* No tension (doesn't spring back) = overfermented
It works for both bulk fermentation AND final proof.
________________


HOW TO DO THE POKE TEST
________________


STEP 1: Flour your finger [Photo: Finger being dipped in flour]
Why? So your finger doesn't stick to the dough and give you a false reading.
________________


STEP 2: Poke the dough firmly [Photo: Finger poking dough about ½ inch deep]
* Press down about ½ inch deep
* Use steady, firm pressure
* Not gentle, not aggressive - just firm
________________


STEP 3: Remove your finger and watch [Photo sequence showing the three outcomes]
Now watch what the dough does:
________________


THREE OUTCOMES
________________


OUTCOME 1: SPRINGS BACK FAST ❌
[Photo: Indent filling back in quickly within 1-2 seconds]
What you see:
* Hole fills back in almost immediately
* Within 1-2 seconds, indent is mostly or completely gone
* Dough bounces back strongly
What it means:
* Too much tension
* Gluten is still tight
* NOT READY YET
What to do:
* During bulk: Wait 30-60 more minutes, test again
* During proof: Let it proof longer
________________


OUTCOME 2: SPRINGS BACK SLOWLY ✓
[Photo: Indent slowly filling back in, coming back about halfway, slight impression remains]
What you see:
* Hole starts to fill back in slowly
* Takes 3-5 seconds
* Comes back about halfway
* Leaves a slight indent - doesn't fully disappear
What it means:
* Perfect balance of tension and relaxation
* Gluten is relaxed but still has strength
* READY!
What to do:
* During bulk: Shape it now
* During proof: Bake it now (or soon)
This is what you're looking for.
________________


OUTCOME 3: DOESN'T SPRING BACK ❌
[Photo: Indent stays, hole remains, no spring back at all]
What you see:
* Hole just stays there
* Zero spring-back
* Indent remains completely
* Dough might even look a little collapsed
What it means:
* Gluten has broken down
* Structure is weak
* OVERFERMENTED
What to do:
* During bulk: Shape it immediately and bake - don't wait longer
* During proof: Bake it now
* Learn from it for next time
Overfermented dough can still be baked, it just won't be optimal.
________________


TIPS FOR ACCURATE POKE TESTS
Location matters:
* Poke in the center or slightly off-center
* Don't poke right on the edge
Depth matters:
* Go about ½ inch deep
* Not too shallow (won't get accurate reading)
* Not too deep (you're not trying to deflate it)
Watch carefully:
* Really observe what the dough does
* Timing matters (1 second vs. 5 seconds is the difference)
When in doubt, compare:
* Do two pokes in different spots
* Does it behave consistently?
________________


POKE TEST FOR BULK VS. PROOF
The test is the same, but timing is different:
________________


DURING BULK FERMENTATION:
* Test when dough looks 50-75% risen
* Usually test once or twice during bulk
* Trust the poke test more than the clock
DURING FINAL PROOF (Room temp):
* Test when dough looks puffy
* Usually 2-4 hours after shaping
* Slow spring-back = ready to bake
DURING COLD PROOF:
* Test right after removing from fridge
* Cold dough is stiffer, so spring-back might be faster - that's okay
* You can bake slightly underproofed from cold - you'll get great oven spring
________________


COMMON QUESTIONS
Q: What if one spot passes the test but another doesn't? A: Use the reading from the center of the dough. Edges are always a bit different.
Q: What if I'm not sure if it sprang back halfway or more than halfway? A: When in doubt during bulk, wait another 30 minutes. Better to be slightly over than under.
Q: Can I do multiple poke tests? A: Yes, but don't do it 10 times - you're deflating the dough. 1-2 tests is enough.
Q: Does the poke test work for whole wheat dough? A: Yes, same principles apply.
Q: My dough is really wet and sticky - can I still poke it? A: Yes! Flour your finger really well. The test still works.
________________


TRUST THE POKE TEST
Forget timing.
Forget doubling in size.
Forget how it "should" feel.
Do the poke test.
Slow spring-back = ready.
It's that simple.

	________________


These are guidelines, not rules. Always trust visual/tactile cues over the clock.
________________


HOW TO MEASURE YOUR KITCHEN TEMPERATURE
Use a thermometer:
* Place it near where your dough will ferment
* Check it at the time of day you'll be baking
* Temperature changes throughout the day
Or estimate:
* If you're comfortable in shorts and t-shirt: probably 70-75°F
* If you need a sweater: probably 65-70°F
* If you're hot and sweaty: probably 75-80°F+
________________


FINDING THE WARM SPOTS IN YOUR KITCHEN
Warmest spots (75-80°F+):
* ☐ Top of refrigerator
* ☐ Inside turned-off oven with light on
* ☐ Near (not on) a radiator or heating vent
* ☐ Inside microwave with a mug of just-boiled water (door closed)
* ☐ Sunny windowsill (watch out - can get too hot)
Cool spots (65-70°F):
* ☐ Counter away from heat sources
* ☐ Basement
* ☐ Cooler room in the house
Too cold spots (below 65°F):
* ☐ Garage (winter)
* ☐ Unheated room
________________


CONTROLLING FERMENTATION WITH TEMPERATURE
________________


TO SPEED UP FERMENTATION:
When: You want faster bulk, or your kitchen is cold
How:
1. Use warm water (80-90°F) when mixing dough
2. Place dough in warmest spot in kitchen
3. Create a warm environment:
   * Turn oven light on, place dough inside (oven OFF)
   * Use a proofing box if you have one
   * Place bowl in larger bowl with warm water around it
Can get it done in 3-4 hours even in a cool kitchen
________________


TO SLOW DOWN FERMENTATION:
When: You need more flexibility in timing, or your kitchen is too warm
How:
1. Use cool water (60-70°F) when mixing dough
2. Place dough in coolest spot in kitchen
3. Or use the fridge as a pause button:
   * Dough fermenting too fast? Put it in the fridge.
   * Fermentation slows to a crawl
   * Take it out when you're ready to continue
Example schedule:
* 3:00 PM - Mix dough
* 5:00 PM - Need to leave the house
* Put dough in fridge
* 8:00 PM - Return home, take dough out
* Let it warm up and continue fermenting
________________


SEASONAL ADJUSTMENTS
________________


SUMMER BAKING (HOT KITCHEN)
Challenges:
* Fermentation goes too fast
* Hard to control timing
* Risk of overfermentation
Solutions:
* Use cool water (60-65°F)
* Use less starter (2/3 of the amount)
* Put dough in coolest spot
* Check earlier than usual
* Consider overnight cold bulk in fridge
________________


WINTER BAKING (COLD KITCHEN)
Challenges:
* Fermentation goes too slow
* Bulk takes forever
* Starter is sluggish
Solutions:
* Use warm water (85-90°F)
* Place dough in warmest spot
* Turn oven light on, ferment inside
* Be patient - it will happen
* Consider starting in evening, letting it go overnight
________________


OVERNIGHT BULK FERMENTATION
When to use: When your schedule doesn't allow for daytime bulk, or your kitchen is cold
How it works:
* Mix dough in evening (around 9-10 PM)
* Use cool water and/or refrigerate for part of the time
* Let it bulk overnight (8-12 hours)
* Shape in the morning
Example schedule:
* 9:00 PM - Mix dough, do folds
* 10:30 PM - Place in coolest spot (or in fridge)
* 7:00 AM - Check dough (should be ready or close)
* 7:30 AM - Shape and into fridge
* 6:00 PM - Bake
Works great for cold kitchens (60-65°F). Not recommended for hot kitchens (75°F+).
________________


DOUGH TEMPERATURE (Advanced)
Professional bakers track dough temperature (not just room temp).
Ideal dough temperature after mixing: 75-78°F
How to adjust:
* If dough is too warm: Use cooler water
* If dough is too cold: Use warmer water
To calculate water temp needed: This is getting advanced, but the formula is:
Water temp = (Desired dough temp × 3) - (Room temp + Flour temp + Friction factor)


For beginners: Don't worry about this yet. Just use room temp water and adjust your environment.
________________


THE FRIDGE IS YOUR BEST FRIEND
Use refrigeration strategically:
1. As a pause button during bulk
* Need to leave? Put dough in fridge
* Fermentation nearly stops
* Take it out when ready to continue
2. For cold final proof (our recommendation)
* Shape dough
* Put in fridge for 12-48 hours
* Total flexibility on when to bake
* Better flavor development
* Easier to score (cold dough is firmer)
3. To slow down fast fermentation
* Hot summer day, dough is moving too fast
* Put in fridge for 30-60 minutes to slow it down
* Take out and continue
________________

SECTION 7: SHAPING BASICS
SECTION 7: SHAPING BASICS
Color: Purple tab
________________


PAGE 1: WHY SHAPING MATTERS
The Bridge Between Fermentation and Baking
Shaping is where you give your dough its final structure before the oven
________________


WHAT IS SHAPING?
Shaping is the process of taking your fermented dough and forming it into a tight, structured loaf that will:
* Hold its form
* Rise UP instead of spreading OUT
* Have an even, attractive crumb
* Develop a beautiful crust
Think of it like this: Bulk fermentation made your dough airy and full of gas. Shaping organizes that gas into the structure you want, creating tension on the surface so it all rises in the right direction.
________________


WHY SHAPING MATTERS
________________


1. SURFACE TENSION = OVEN SPRING
[Simple diagram showing two loaves side by side: one with good tension rising up, one without spreading out]
Good surface tension:
* Dough holds its shape
* Rises upward in the oven
* Gets dramatic "oven spring" (final burst of rise)
* Beautiful tall loaf
Poor surface tension:
* Dough spreads outward
* Minimal rise in oven
* Flat, pancake-like loaf
* Disappointing
Surface tension is created during shaping.
________________


2. CRUMB STRUCTURE
Well-shaped dough has:
* Even distribution of gas bubbles
* Consistent crumb throughout
* Nice irregular holes (not giant holes in some spots, dense in others)
Poorly shaped dough has:
* Uneven crumb
* Giant holes at the top, dense at bottom
* Weird texture
________________


3. APPEARANCE
A well-shaped loaf:
* Looks professional
* Has smooth, taut surface
* Scores beautifully
* You're proud to share it
A poorly shaped loaf:
* Looks rough and uneven
* Might have wrinkles or folds
* Scores tear awkwardly
* Still tastes good but doesn't look as nice
________________


THE TWO-STEP SHAPING PROCESS
Professional bakers shape in two stages:
________________


STEP 1: PRE-SHAPE
What it is: A gentle first shape that organizes the dough into a rough round
Why do it:
* Redistributes gas bubbles evenly
* Creates initial structure
* Makes final shaping easier
How long it takes: 1-2 minutes
Then what: Let it rest (bench rest) for 15-30 minutes
________________


STEP 2: FINAL SHAPE
What it is: The final, tighter shape with maximum surface tension
Why do it:
* Creates the tight skin that makes bread rise up
* Gives the loaf its final form
How long it takes: 2-3 minutes
Then what: Into the banneton for final proof
________________


THE BENCH REST - WHY IT MATTERS
After pre-shaping, you let the dough rest for 15-30 minutes. This is called a bench rest.
Why?
When you shape dough, you tighten the gluten. It becomes resistant and fights you. If you try to do the final shape immediately, the dough will:
* Spring back
* Resist your hands
* Not hold the tension you're creating
* Be frustrating to work with
After a bench rest:
* Gluten relaxes
* Dough becomes workable again
* Final shaping is easy and smooth
* Tension holds beautifully
Don't skip the bench rest. Those 15-20 minutes make a huge difference.
________________


BASIC SHAPES: WHAT YOU'LL LEARN TODAY
Today we're teaching: BOULE (round loaf)
[Photo: Beautiful round boule loaf]
Why start with boule:
* Simplest shape for beginners
* Most forgiving
* Works in any banneton or bowl
* Easy to score
* Looks impressive
Other shapes you'll learn in future classes:
* Bâtard (oval)
* Batard (torpedo)
* Pan loaf
Master the boule first. Everything else builds on these same principles.
________________


HANDLING FERMENTED DOUGH
Be gentle but deliberate.
Your dough after bulk fermentation is:
* Full of gas bubbles (you worked hard to create those!)
* Delicate (can be deflated if handled roughly)
* Sticky (especially if high hydration)
When shaping:
* Work with confidence, not fear
* Be gentle, but don't be so timid you can't create tension
* Some degassing is normal and okay
* You're not trying to preserve every single bubble
It's a balance: Gentle enough not to destroy your work, firm enough to create structure.
________________


COMMON SHAPING MISTAKES
We'll show you these in detail on the next pages, but here's what to avoid:
❌ Too much flour - Makes dough slide instead of grip ❌ Not enough tension - Loaf spreads in oven ❌ Too tight - Dough tears, structure breaks ❌ Rough handling - Deflates all the bubbles ❌ Uneven seams - Dough leaks during proof ❌ Skipping the bench rest - Final shape fights you
✓ Just right: Gentle but firm, good tension, clean seams, proper rest
________________


YOU'LL GET BETTER WITH PRACTICE
Your first shaped loaf might:
* Look a little rough
* Not have perfect tension
* Be a bit uneven
That's completely normal.
Shaping is a physical skill. Your hands need to learn what "right" feels like. By your 3rd or 4th loaf, you'll start to get it. By your 10th, it'll feel natural.
Don't expect perfection on loaf #1. Just follow the steps and trust the process.
________________


PAGE 2-3: BOULE SHAPING - STEP BY STEP
Your First Shape: The Round Loaf (Boule)
Follow these steps and you'll create a beautiful, tight boule
________________


PHASE 1: PRE-SHAPE
Step 1: Prepare Your Surface
[Photo: Clean counter with light dusting of flour]
What to do:
* Clear your counter
* Dust very lightly with flour
* Not a lot - just enough so dough doesn't stick
* Have your bench scraper ready
Why light flour:
* Too much flour: Dough slides, can't create tension
* No flour: Dough sticks to counter
* Light dusting: Perfect grip
________________


Step 2: Turn Out the Dough
[Photo: Dough being gently turned out of bowl onto counter]
What to do:
* Tip your bowl over slightly
* Use your bench scraper to help release the dough
* Let it gently fall onto the counter
* It will spread out - that's normal
The dough will look:
* Slack and relaxed
* Wants to spread
* Full of bubbles (you might see them inside)
________________


Step 3: Pre-Shape Into a Round
[Photo sequence: 4 photos showing the folding motion]
What to do:
Photo 1: Grab the edge of the dough closest to you
Photo 2: Fold it up and over toward the center (like folding a letter)
Photo 3: Rotate the dough 90 degrees (quarter turn)
Photo 4: Repeat - grab the edge, fold to center
Continue this 6-8 times, working your way around the dough in a circle, until you've created a rough round package.
What you're doing:
* Organizing the dough
* Creating initial structure
* Redistributing gas bubbles
* Building some tension (but not maximum yet)
________________


Step 4: Flip It Over
[Photo: Hands flipping the dough so seam side is down]
What to do:
* Use your bench scraper to help flip the dough
* Seam side (rough side with all the folds) goes DOWN
* Smooth side goes UP
Now you should have:
* A rough round shape
* Smooth side facing up
* All the seams underneath
________________


Step 5: Cover and Rest (Bench Rest)
[Photo: Dough covered with towel or bowl]
What to do:
* Cover dough with a towel or bowl (so it doesn't dry out)
* Set a timer for 15-20 minutes
* Walk away
* Let the gluten relax
During this rest:
* Gluten relaxes
* Dough becomes more extensible
* Final shaping will be much easier
If you're shaping multiple loaves:
* Pre-shape them all
* Let them all rest together
* Then final shape them in the same order
Don't skip this rest. Seriously. It matters.
________________


PHASE 2: FINAL SHAPE
15-20 minutes have passed, dough has relaxed
________________


Step 6: Lightly Flour the Top
[Photo: Dough with light dusting of flour on top]
What to do:
* Dust the top of your dough lightly with flour
* Just enough so your hands don't stick
________________


Step 7: Flip It Over (Again)
[Photo: Dough flipped so smooth side is now down, seam side up]
What to do:
* Flip the dough so the smooth side (which was up) is now DOWN on the counter
* The seam side (which was down) is now UP and facing you
Why flip?
* You're going to create new folds to build more tension
* Those folds will become the bottom (seam side) of your final loaf
________________


Step 8: Create Tension - The Letter Fold
[Photo sequence: 4 photos showing folding from all sides]
This is where you build maximum tension.
Photo 1: Grab the edge farthest from you, stretch it gently up and away (don't rip it), fold it down toward the center
Photo 2: Grab the right edge, stretch gently, fold to center
Photo 3: Grab the left edge, stretch gently, fold to center
Photo 4: Grab the edge closest to you, stretch gently, fold up and over all the way to the far side (like closing an envelope)
Key technique:
* Stretch gently but firmly (don't tear the dough)
* Pull it taut as you fold
* Press down each fold to seal
* You're creating layers and tension
________________


Step 9: Flip One Last Time
[Photo: Dough flipped so smooth side is now UP]
What to do:
* Use your bench scraper to flip the dough one more time
* Seam side (all those folds) is now DOWN on the counter
* Smooth side is UP
* This smooth side will be the top of your loaf
________________


Step 10: Create Surface Tension
[Photo sequence: 3-4 photos showing the cupping and dragging motion]
This is the most important part of shaping.
Photo 1: Cup both hands around the dough like you're holding a ball
Photo 2: Using the friction between dough and counter, pull the dough toward you in a circular motion - about 1-2 inches at a time
Photo 3: Rotate the dough slightly (maybe 30-45 degrees)
Photo 4: Repeat - cup, drag toward you, rotate
Do this 5-8 times, working around the dough.
What you should see:
* The surface gets tighter and tighter
* The dough pulls into a rounder shape
* The skin on top becomes smooth and taut
* The dough starts to "stand up" more
What you should feel:
* Resistance as you drag
* The dough wants to hold its shape
* Surface tension building
The key: You're using the friction between dough and counter to pull the surface tight. Don't press down - pull horizontally.
________________


Step 11: Check Your Work
[Photo: Final shaped boule, smooth and taut, sitting on counter]
Your shaped boule should:
* Be round (ish - doesn't have to be perfect)
* Have a smooth, taut surface
* Hold its shape (not immediately spreading)
* Have visible surface tension
If it's not quite right:
* Do a few more drag-and-rotate motions
* You can re-work it a bit
Don't over-work it though:
* If you've been shaping for 5+ minutes, stop
* It's good enough
* You'll get better with practice
________________


Step 12: Into the Banneton
[Photo: Lifting dough with bench scraper, placing in heavily floured banneton seam-side UP]
What to do:
1. Flour your banneton HEAVILY

   * If using a liner: Rub flour into every crevice
   * If flour-dusted: Make sure it's really well coated
   * Don't be shy - use more flour than you think
   2. Use your bench scraper to gently lift the dough

   3. Quickly but gently flip it into the banneton

      * Seam side goes UP (into the banneton)
      * Smooth side goes DOWN (bottom of the banneton)
Why seam side up?
      * When you flip it out to bake, seam side will be down
      * Smooth side will be up (which is what you score)
      4. Pinch the seam if it looks loose
      * Make sure it's sealed
      * You don't want it opening during proof
________________


Step 13: Into the Fridge
[Photo: Banneton covered with plastic bag or shower cap]
What to do:
      * Cover banneton with a plastic bag, shower cap, or reusable cover
      * Place in refrigerator for cold proof
      * Relax - you're done shaping!
Cold proof timing:
      * Minimum: 12 hours
      * Sweet spot: 18-24 hours
      * Maximum: 48 hours

PAGE 4: COMMON SHAPING PROBLEMS
Troubleshooting Your Shape
________________


PROBLEM 1: Dough Keeps Spreading, Won't Hold Shape
[Photo: Dough that has spread into a flat disk after shaping]
What it looks like:
      * You shape it, walk away, come back and it's spread out
      * Looks like a thick pancake
      * No structure
Causes:
1. Overfermented dough
      * Gluten has broken down
      * No strength left
2. Not enough surface tension during shaping
      * Didn't do enough drag-and-rotate
      * Didn't pull it tight enough
3. Too much flour on counter
      * Dough slides instead of grips
      * Can't create tension
________________


Solutions:
If overfermented:
      * Shape it carefully but quickly
      * Get it into the fridge
      * Bake sooner rather than later
      * Next time: don't let bulk go so long
If not enough tension:
      * Go back and do more drag-and-rotate motions
      * Really pull it taut
      * Be more aggressive with creating tension
If too much flour:
      * Wipe some flour off the counter
      * You need friction to create tension
________________


PROBLEM 2: Dough Tears During Shaping
[Photo: Dough with torn surface]
What it looks like:
      * Surface rips open
      * Gluten structure is breaking
      * Might see large holes
Causes:
1. Too tight, too aggressive
      * You're pulling too hard
      * Stretching beyond what the dough can handle
2. Dough is too cold
      * Cold dough is stiff and less extensible
3. Didn't let it rest enough (bench rest)
      * Gluten is still tight from pre-shape
________________


Solutions:
Be gentler:
      * Pull with less force
      * Stretch gently, not aggressively
      * Build tension gradually
Warm the dough slightly:
      * If it came from the fridge, let it warm up for 30 minutes
Longer bench rest:
      * Give it 20-30 minutes instead of 15
      * Let that gluten relax fully
________________


PROBLEM 3: Seam Won't Stay Closed
[Photo: Dough with seam opening up]
What it looks like:
      * After shaping, the seam (bottom) starts opening
      * Might leak during proof
      * Dough loses structure
Causes:
1. Didn't press folds down firmly
      * The layers aren't sealed to each other
2. Too much flour on the seams
      * Flour prevents dough from sticking to itself
3. Not enough tension
      * The pull of surface tension should help hold seam closed
________________


Solutions:
Press firmly:
      * When making folds, press down to seal
      * Use the heel of your hand
Less flour:
      * Don't flour the surface that will become seams
      * Only flour the outside
Pinch the seam:
      * After getting it into the banneton, pinch the seam closed
      * Use your fingers to seal it
________________


PROBLEM 4: Loaf Is Lopsided or Uneven
[Photo: Misshapen boule, one side higher than other]
What it looks like:
      * Not round
      * One side is taller
      * Asymmetrical
Causes:
1. Uneven tension
      * You pulled one side tighter than the other
2. Shaped on uneven surface
      * Counter isn't level
3. Placed in banneton off-center
      * Dough settled unevenly
________________


Solutions:
Even tension all around:
      * Do the drag-and-rotate evenly
      * Work your way around the whole dough
Check your surface:
      * Make sure counter is level
Center it in banneton:
      * Place dough in the very center
      * It should sit evenly
Honestly: A slightly lopsided loaf still tastes great. Don't stress too much about perfect symmetry.
________________


PROBLEM 5: Too Sticky to Handle
[Photo: Dough sticking to hands and counter badly]
What it looks like:
      * Sticks to everything
      * Can't shape it without making a mess
      * Frustrating
Causes:
1. High hydration dough
      * 75%+ hydration is naturally sticky
      * This is normal for some recipes
2. Not enough flour on surface/hands
      * Need more dusting
3. Warm, humid day
      * Dough absorbs moisture from air
________________


Solutions:
Flour management:
      * Keep a bowl of flour nearby
      * Dust your hands frequently
      * Dust bench scraper
      * Light layer on counter
Work quickly:
      * Don't dawdle
      * The longer you handle it, the stickier it gets
Wet hands instead:
      * For very wet doughs, wet hands work better than floury hands
      * Dough won't stick to wet hands
Use bench scraper as extension of hands:
      * Scrape up dough instead of grabbing with hands
      * Flip with scraper, not fingers
________________


PROBLEM 6: Dough Sticks to Banneton
[Photo: Dough stuck in banneton when trying to flip out]
What it looks like:
      * When you flip banneton to remove dough, it sticks
      * Might tear the surface
      * Panic ensues
Causes:
1. Not enough flour in banneton
      * This is the #1 cause
      * You need MORE flour than you think
2. Dough is too wet on surface
      * The seam side was wet when it went in
________________


Solutions:
FLOUR YOUR BANNETON HEAVILY:
      * Like, really flour it
      * Rub flour into every crevice if using liner
      * Think "way too much flour" and you're probably at "enough flour"
      * This is not the place to be conservative
Dust the dough too:
      * Before placing in banneton, dust the seam side lightly
If it does stick:
      * Don't panic
      * Gently work your fingers around the edge
      * Slowly peel it away
      * If surface tears a bit, just score over it - it'll be fine

SHAPING TIPS & TRICKS
✓ Practice with non-sourdough dough first if you're nervous - make a simple bread dough and practice shaping
✓ Watch videos - Shaping is easier to learn by watching than reading
✓ Your first 3 loaves will be rough - that's expected
✓ By loaf #5-10 you'll have the feel for it
✓ Use your bench scraper constantly - it's your best friend
✓ Confidence matters - hesitant, timid shaping doesn't create tension
✓ But don't be brutal - firm and gentle, not rough
✓ The bench rest is non-negotiable - seriously, don't skip it
✓ Different doughs feel different - wet vs. dry, white vs. whole grain - adjust accordingly
________________


REMEMBER: ADVANCED SHAPING IS IN THE NEXT CLASS
What we've taught you today:
      * ✓ Basic boule shape
      * ✓ Pre-shape and final shape
      * ✓ Creating surface tension
      * ✓ Getting it into the banneton
What's coming in the Intermediate Class:
      * Multiple shaping techniques (bâtard, batard, pan loaf)
      * Shaping very high-hydration doughs
      * Shaping with inclusions (nuts, cheese, etc.)
      * Creating specific crumb patterns through shaping
      * Advanced tension techniques
For now: Master the boule. That's enough.

PAGE 1: HOW TO BUILD YOUR SCHEDULE
Working Backwards From Fresh Bread
The secret to fitting sourdough into your life
________________


THE REVERSE-ENGINEERING METHOD
Most beginners think: "I'll start baking and see when it's done."
Better approach: "I want fresh bread at [specific time]. Let me work backwards."
Why this works:
      * You control the schedule, it doesn't control you
      * You can plan around work, kids, life
      * No surprises or midnight baking sessions
      * Reduces stress
________________


THE BASIC TIMELINE
Here's what happens in a typical sourdough bake:
FEED STARTER → Mix Dough → Bulk Fermentation → Shape → Final Proof → Bake → BREAD!
   ↓             ↓              ↓                ↓          ↓          ↓
  4-6 hrs      5 min         4-6 hrs         5 min    12-48 hrs    45 min


Total time: About 24-36 hours from feeding starter to fresh bread
Total ACTIVE time: About 30-45 minutes spread across 1-2 days
________________


STEP-BY-STEP: BUILDING YOUR SCHEDULE
Let's say you want fresh bread Saturday at 9:00 AM.
________________


STEP 1: When do you want bread? → Saturday, 9:00 AM
________________


STEP 2: Work backwards - Baking time
Bread bakes for ~45 minutes
So it goes IN the oven at: → Saturday, 8:15 AM
________________


STEP 3: Work backwards - Preheat time
Oven and Dutch oven need 1 hour to preheat
So you start preheating at: → Saturday, 7:15 AM
________________


STEP 4: Work backwards - Final proof
For cold proof (our recommendation): 12-24 hours in fridge
Let's use 13 hours (overnight)
So dough needs to be shaped and in fridge by: → Friday, 6:15 PM
(If you want longer flavor development, shape it earlier - say Friday 8 AM - and proof 24 hours)
________________


STEP 5: Work backwards - Bulk fermentation
Usually takes 4-6 hours depending on temperature
Let's use 5 hours
So dough needs to be mixed by: → Friday, 1:15 PM
________________


STEP 6: Work backwards - Starter needs to be ready
Starter should be at peak when you mix dough
So starter needs to be fed by: → Friday, 7:15 AM (6 hours before mixing)
________________

9:00 AM  - FRESH BREAD!


________________


ADJUSTING FOR YOUR KITCHEN
If your kitchen is warmer (75-80°F):
      * Bulk will take 4 hours instead of 5
      * Feed starter 5 hours before mixing instead of 6
      * Everything moves up by an hour
If your kitchen is cooler (65-70°F):
      * Bulk might take 6-7 hours
      * Feed starter 7-8 hours before mixing
      * Everything moves back by 1-2 hours
This is why we emphasize: Watch the dough, not just the clock.
________________


FLEXIBILITY POINTS IN YOUR SCHEDULE
You can adjust timing at several points:
1. Starter feeding ratio
      * Use 1:5:5 ratio if you want it ready in 8-12 hours (overnight)
      * Use 1:1:1 ratio if you want it ready in 4-6 hours (same day)
2. Cold proof length
      * Minimum 12 hours, maximum 48 hours
      * This is your biggest flexibility window
      * Want to bake Sunday instead of Saturday? Just leave it in the fridge another day
3. Bulk fermentation location
      * Put in warm spot = faster bulk
      * Put in cool spot = slower bulk
      * Put in fridge partway through = pause button
4. Starting time
      * You can start earlier or later
      * The timeline stays the same, just shifts
________________


THE FRIDGE IS YOUR SECRET WEAPON
Cold proof gives you MASSIVE flexibility:
Let's say you shape Friday at 6 PM.
You could bake:
      * Saturday 9 AM (15 hours cold proof)
      * Saturday 6 PM (24 hours cold proof)
      * Sunday 9 AM (39 hours cold proof)
      * Sunday evening (48 hours cold proof)
Same shaping time, four different bake times.
This is why cold proofing is perfect for beginners.
________________


WHAT IF LIFE HAPPENS?
Scenario 1: Bulk fermentation is going faster than expected → Put dough in fridge to slow it down → Take it out later when you're ready
Scenario 2: You need to leave during bulk → Put dough in fridge → It will hold for hours → Take out and continue when you return
Scenario 3: You're not ready to bake when the proof is done → It's in the fridge, it can wait → You've got 12-48 hour window
Scenario 4: You mixed dough but life got crazy → Shape it, put it in fridge → Bake it whenever you can in next 2 days
The fridge solves almost every timing problem.

      * Mix dough at 9 PM
      * Do 2 folds (9:30 and 10:00 PM)
      * Put in fridge at 10:30 PM
      * Take out at 5:30 AM, let warm up for 30 min
      * Finish bulk with 1-2 more folds
      * Shape around 6:30 AM before work
Don't want to wake up early Tuesday?
      * Shape Monday night (around 11 PM after bulk finishes)
      * Cold proof overnight and all day Tuesday (21 hours)
      * Bake Tuesday evening as scheduled

PAGE 6: TROUBLESHOOTING SCHEDULES
When Life Doesn't Follow Your Plan
________________


PROBLEM: Starter isn't ready when I need to mix dough
Solution 1: Wait longer
      * Check every 30 minutes
      * Use it when peaked, adjust all other times accordingly
Solution 2: Put it in a warmer spot
      * Top of fridge, inside turned-off oven with light on
      * Can speed it up
Solution 3: Next time, feed it earlier or with different ratio
      * Use 1:1:1 for faster rise
      * Or feed it an hour earlier
________________


PROBLEM: Bulk fermentation is taking way longer than expected
Your kitchen is cooler than you thought.
Solution 1: Move to warmer spot
      * Top of fridge, warm room, etc.
Solution 2: Wait it out
      * Might take 7-8 hours in cool kitchen
      * That's okay - watch the dough, not the clock
Solution 3: Next time, start earlier
      * If it took 7 hours today, plan for 7 hours next time
________________


PROBLEM: Bulk fermentation finished too early
Your kitchen is warmer than you thought, or starter was very active.
Solution 1: Shape it now and adjust everything else
      * Bake earlier than planned, or
      * Let it cold proof longer
Solution 2: Put it in fridge to pause
      * Slows fermentation dramatically
      * Resume when you're ready
Solution 3: Next time, start later
      * If it only took 3 hours today, plan accordingly next time
________________


PROBLEM: I need to leave in the middle of bulk
Solution: Put dough in fridge
      * Fermentation slows to crawl
      * Can stay there for hours
      * Take out when you return
      * Let warm up for 30 minutes
      * Continue bulk fermentation
________________


PROBLEM: I need to leave in the middle of folds
Relax - folds aren't critical minute-by-minute.
Solution: Do what you can
      * If you miss a fold, no big deal
      * Just do the next one when you return
      * Or skip a fold entirely - 3 folds instead of 4 is fine
________________


PROBLEM: I shaped it but now I can't bake when I planned
If it's in the fridge: Solution: Leave it longer
      * It can go 12-48 hours
      * Just bake it later
If it's at room temp: Solution: Put it in the fridge
      * Even if it's only been 1 hour
      * Cold pauses fermentation
      * Bake when ready
________________


PROBLEM: I'm ready to bake but dough seems underproofed
Solution 1: Wait longer
      * Let it come to room temp for 30-60 minutes
      * Then bake
Solution 2: Bake it anyway
      * Underproofed bread from cold is often fine
      * You'll still get good oven spring
      * Won't be your best loaf but will be good
________________


PROBLEM: I'm ready to bake but dough seems overproofed
Solution: Bake it immediately
      * Don't wait any longer
      * It won't be your best loaf
      * But it's still bakeable
      * Learn from it for next time
________________


PROBLEM: My schedule never works out
You need the FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE approach:
New approach:
      1. Shape and put in fridge
      2. Don't commit to a bake time
      3. Bake anytime in the next 12-48 hours whenever life allows
      4. This is the most forgiving way to bake
________________


THE GOLDEN RULES OF SCHEDULE FLEXIBILITY:
✓ The fridge is a pause button - use it whenever you need time
✓ Temperature controls speed - warmer = faster, cooler = slower
✓ Cold proof has a HUGE window - 12-48 hours gives you options
✓ Don't panic when times don't match - the dough doesn't know your plan
✓ Trust visual/tactile cues over the clock - windowpane, poke test, volume
✓ Your second loaf will be easier - you'll know your kitchen better
✓ Take notes - track actual times so you can adjust next time
________________


REMEMBER:
Sourdough bakers have been making bread for thousands of years without timers or schedules written down.
The dough tells you when it's ready. Learn to listen to it.
The schedule is a guide, not a rulebook.

PAGE 1: WHEN BREAD DOESN'T GO AS PLANNED
Every Baker Has Failed Loaves
Learning what went wrong is how you get better
________________


FIRST: YOUR BREAD IS PROBABLY STILL EDIBLE
Before we dive into problems and solutions, remember:
Most "failed" sourdough is still delicious.
      * Too dense? Makes amazing toast and croutons
      * Too sour? Perfect for grilled cheese or dipping in soup
      * Flat loaf? Still has great flavor, just slice it thinner
      * Gummy? Let it sit another day, it often improves
Very few bread failures are actual garbage. Don't throw it away - eat it, learn from it, and do better next time.

HOW TO USE THIS SECTION
Step 1: Find the photo that looks most like your bread
Step 2: Read what caused it
Step 3: Note what to change next time
Step 4: Keep baking - you'll get better with each loaf
________________


THE MOST COMMON ISSUES
In this section, we cover:
      1. Dense, gummy crumb
      2. Flat loaf with no oven spring
      3. Huge holes with dense spots (uneven crumb)
      4. Pale, soft crust
      5. Burnt crust, raw inside
      6. Loaf spread out flat instead of rising up
      7. Brick-hard crust
      8. Way too sour
      9. Not sour at all
      10. Scoring tears and blowouts
      11. No "ear" on the score
      12. Stuck to banneton
Remember: Even experienced bakers have off days. This is all part of the journey.

PAGE 2: CRUMB PROBLEMS
________________


PROBLEM #1: DENSE, GUMMY CRUMB
[LARGE PHOTO: Cross-section of bread showing very tight, dense crumb with few small holes, looks heavy and compact]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Tight, dense crumb (not many holes)
      * Texture is gummy or dough-like when you press it
      * Feels heavy
      * Might be slightly undercooked in the center
      * No light, airy structure
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Underfermented bulk
      * You didn't let bulk fermentation go long enough
      * Dough didn't rise 50-75%
      * Poke test probably sprang back too fast
      * Not enough gas was produced to create an open crumb
Other possible causes:
Not enough gluten development
      * Didn't pass windowpane test
      * Gluten couldn't trap the gas that was produced
      * [See Section 5: Mixing & Gluten Development]
Underbaked
      * Pulled from oven too soon
      * Center didn't fully cook
      * Internal temp below 200°F
      * Appears gummy because it's still doughy inside
Weak starter
      * Starter wasn't active enough
      * Didn't have enough yeast to raise the dough
      * [See Section 4: Starter Deep Dive]
Too much whole grain flour
      * Whole wheat/rye creates denser crumb naturally
      * Bran cuts gluten strands
      * Need to adjust expectations or hydration
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Let bulk fermentation go longer
      * Wait for 50-75% rise
      * Trust the poke test (slow spring-back)
      * Don't rush this step
      * [See Section 6: Fermentation Visual Guide]
✓ Ensure gluten is fully developed
      * Must pass windowpane test before bulk
      * Do all 4 folds
✓ Bake longer
      * Until deep golden brown
      * Internal temp at least 200°F (205°F is even better)
      * Don't pull it early
✓ Use active, vigorous starter
      * Should double in 4-6 hours
      * Should pass float test easily
✓ If using whole grains, increase hydration
      * Whole wheat absorbs more water
      * Add 10-20g more water per 100g whole grain flour
________________


IS IT STILL GOOD?
Yes! Dense bread makes:
      * Excellent toast (crisps up beautifully)
      * Great croutons
      * Perfect for sandwiches (holds up to fillings)
      * French toast base
________________


PROBLEM #2: HUGE HOLES WITH DENSE SPOTS (UNEVEN CRUMB)
[LARGE PHOTO: Cross-section showing giant irregular holes at top, very dense compressed crumb at bottom]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Massive holes in some areas (you could fit your finger through)
      * Very dense, tight crumb in other areas
      * Uneven, irregular structure throughout
      * Often the big holes are at the top, dense at bottom
      * Looks like two different breads in one loaf
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Poor shaping technique
      * Didn't create even surface tension
      * Trapped big air pockets when shaping
      * Uneven distribution during pre-shape
      * [See Section 7: Shaping Basics]
Other possible causes:
Overfermented bulk
      * Let it go too far (over 75% rise)
      * Gluten started breaking down
      * Large bubbles formed and merged
      * Some areas collapsed while others stayed inflated
Inconsistent folding during bulk
      * Some areas got more folds than others
      * Gluten development was uneven
Rough handling before baking
      * Knocked out gas from some areas
      * Left other areas intact
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Improve shaping technique
      * Do proper pre-shape to even out gas distribution
      * Create consistent surface tension all around
      * Don't trap large air pockets
      * Practice the drag-and-rotate motion
✓ Don't overferment bulk
      * Stop at 50-75% rise
      * Don't let it go beyond that
      * Poke test should show slow spring, not no spring
✓ Even folding during bulk
      * Make sure you're stretching all sides equally
      * Work systematically around the dough
✓ Handle gently but consistently
      * Don't punch down one area and baby another
      * Uniform, gentle handling
________________


IS IT STILL GOOD?
Absolutely! It actually looks kind of cool and artisanal. The flavor is usually great. The giant holes might make it hard to spread butter on, but it's still delicious bread.
________________


PROBLEM #3: VERY TIGHT CRUMB, NO HOLES AT ALL
[LARGE PHOTO: Cross-section showing extremely tight, sandwich-bread-like crumb with almost no visible holes]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Crumb looks like sandwich bread (uniform, tiny cells)
      * No irregular holes
      * Very tight structure throughout
      * Almost no air pockets
      * Dense but not necessarily gummy
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Definitely: Severely underfermented
      * Bulk didn't go nearly long enough
      * Probably only rose 20-30%, not 50-75%
      * Yeast didn't produce enough CO₂
      * This is the #1 beginner mistake
Could also be:
Very weak starter
      * Starter had very little yeast activity
      * Couldn't produce enough gas
Too cold during bulk
      * Kitchen was very cold (under 65°F)
      * Fermentation barely happened
      * Needed much more time
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Let bulk go MUCH longer
      * This needed probably 3-4 more hours
      * Watch for that 50-75% rise
      * Be patient - it takes time
      * [See Section 6: Fermentation Guide]
✓ Make sure starter is strong
      * Should double in 4-6 hours when fed
      * Should pass float test
      * Very active and bubbly
✓ Ferment in warmer spot
      * If kitchen is cold, find warm spot
      * Top of fridge, oven with light on
      * Aim for 70-75°F
________________


IS IT STILL GOOD?
Yes - it's actually perfect for certain uses:
      * Sandwiches (holds together great)
      * French toast
      * Bread pudding
      * Croutons
________________


PAGE 3: SHAPE & RISE PROBLEMS
________________


PROBLEM #4: FLAT LOAF, NO OVEN SPRING
[LARGE PHOTO: Loaf from the side - very flat, pancake-like, maybe 2-3 inches tall instead of 4-5]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Loaf is flat and wide instead of tall and round
      * Spread out instead of rising up
      * Little to no oven spring (final burst of rise in oven)
      * Might have decent crumb inside but shape is disappointing
      * Looks more like a thick frisbee than a boule
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Overfermented
      * Bulk went too long (over 75-100% rise)
      * Or final proof went too long
      * Gluten broke down
      * Lost structure and strength
      * [See Section 6, Page 2: Overfermented Stage]
Other possible causes:
Poor shaping / no surface tension
      * Didn't create tight skin during shaping
      * Dough wasn't organized properly
      * [See Section 7: Shaping Basics]
Dough too wet
      * Hydration too high for your flour
      * Recipe called for 80%+ hydration
      * Dough couldn't hold shape
Weak starter
      * Very little yeast activity
      * Couldn't produce oven spring
Scored too deep
      * Cut too deep, let all the gas escape
      * Deflated the loaf
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Watch fermentation carefully
      * Stop bulk at 50-75% rise, not more
      * Poke test should show slow spring, not zero spring
      * Don't let cold proof go beyond 48 hours
✓ Create strong surface tension when shaping
      * Really pull that skin tight
      * Do the drag-and-rotate motion 6-8 times
      * Make sure it's taut
✓ Reduce hydration if needed
      * Try 70% hydration instead of 75%+
      * Easier to handle, holds shape better
      * Work your way up to higher hydration as you gain skill
✓ Score at proper depth
      * Only ½ inch deep, not deeper
      * 30-45° angle
      * One decisive slash
________________


PROBLEM #5: LOAF SPREAD OUT WIDE INSTEAD OF TALL
[LARGE PHOTO: Overhead view of very wide, flat loaf that spread during baking]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Loaf is much wider than it should be
      * Spread out to the edges of the Dutch oven
      * Very little height
      * Shape is blob-like instead of round
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Same as Problem #4, but even more extreme:
Definitely overfermented or no surface tension
      * Structure completely gave out
      * Dough had no strength to hold up
      * Relaxed too much
________________


HOW TO FIX IT:
Same as Problem #4, but be even more careful about:
      * Stopping bulk earlier
      * Creating maximum surface tension
      * Possibly reducing hydration
________________


PROBLEM #6: LOAF STUCK IN BANNETON, SURFACE TORN
[LARGE PHOTO: Loaf with torn, messy surface where it stuck to banneton]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Surface is ripped and torn
      * Bits of dough stuck in the banneton
      * Irregular, messy appearance
      * Might have exposed crumb where it tore
      * Frustrating!
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Definitely: Not enough flour in banneton
      * This is the #1 cause
      * You need MORE flour than you think
Could also be:
Dough surface was too wet
      * Seam side was wet when it went in
      * High hydration dough
Banneton liner is worn or sticky
      * Old liners can get sticky
      * Needs replacing or heavy flouring
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ FLOUR YOUR BANNETON HEAVILY
      * Like, really heavily
      * Rub flour into every crevice
      * It should look white/coated
      * Use rice flour (sticks less than wheat flour)
      * This is not the place to be conservative with flour
✓ Dust dough before putting in banneton
      * Lightly dust the seam side
      * Helps prevent sticking
✓ If using liner, flour it thoroughly
      * Work flour into the cloth
      * Make sure it's generously coated
✓ Consider rice flour
      * Rice flour is less sticky than wheat flour
      * Professional trick
________________


WHAT TO DO IF IT HAPPENS:
      * Don't panic
      * Score over the torn areas
      * Bake it anyway
      * It will still taste great
      * The crust will cover most sins
________________


PAGE 4: CRUST & BAKING PROBLEMS
________________


PROBLEM #7: PALE, SOFT CRUST
[LARGE PHOTO: Loaf with very pale, blonde crust, looks undercooked]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Crust is pale blonde or tan instead of deep golden brown
      * Soft crust, not crispy
      * Might look undercooked (even if inside is done)
      * No nice caramelization
      * Not very appetizing
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Oven not hot enough
      * Temperature was too low
      * Oven didn't preheat long enough
      * Dutch oven wasn't hot enough
Other causes:
Not enough steam
      * Baked without lid on Dutch oven
      * Didn't trap steam
      * Crust set before browning
Pulled too early
      * Didn't bake long enough
      * Needed more time
Overfermented dough
      * No sugars left for browning (Maillard reaction)
      * Yeast ate all the sugars during fermentation
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Preheat oven fully
      * Full 1 hour preheat at 450°F
      * Don't skip this step
      * Dutch oven needs to be screaming hot
✓ Bake covered first
      * 20 minutes with lid ON
      * Traps steam
      * Then remove lid for browning
✓ Bake longer uncovered
      * Keep going until DEEP golden brown
      * You want rich color
      * Don't pull it when it's still blonde
✓ Don't overferment
      * Stop bulk at proper time
      * Preserve some sugars for crust development
________________


PROBLEM #8: BURNT/DARK CRUST, RAW INSIDE
[LARGE PHOTO: Loaf with very dark, nearly black crust but gummy interior when cut]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Crust is very dark brown or burnt
      * Inside is still gummy or undercooked
      * Center is raw or dough-like
      * Outside cooked way faster than inside
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Definitely: Oven too hot
      * Temperature was too high
      * Crust set and browned before center could cook
      * Needed lower temp or longer, slower bake
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Lower oven temperature
      * Try 425°F instead of 450°F
      * Or: Bake at 450°F for first 20 min, then drop to 400°F
✓ Bake longer at lower temp
      * Give center time to cook through
      * Aim for 205°F internal temp
✓ Check oven with thermometer
      * Your oven might run hot
      * Get an oven thermometer
      * Adjust dial accordingly
✓ If crust is browning too fast
      * Tent with foil for last 10-15 minutes
      * Lets inside continue cooking without burning outside
________________


PROBLEM #9: BRICK-HARD CRUST
[LARGE PHOTO: Loaf with crust so hard you need a saw to cut it]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Crust is extremely hard and thick
      * Difficult to cut through
      * Might chip your knife
      * Rock-solid exterior
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Baked too long
      * Left in oven too long
      * All moisture evaporated from crust
Could also be:
Baked uncovered the whole time
      * No steam phase
      * Crust set hard immediately
Over-baked after removing lid
      * Uncovered phase went too long (40+ minutes)
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Don't overbake
      * 20 min covered + 20-25 min uncovered is enough
      * Pull when deep golden, not darker
✓ Bake covered first
      * Always do 20 min with lid on
      * Steam keeps crust from hardening
✓ Watch timing on uncovered phase
      * 20-25 minutes uncovered max
      * Not 30-40 minutes
________________


CAN YOU SAVE IT?
Sort of:
      * Store in plastic bag overnight
      * Moisture redistributes
      * Crust softens a bit
      * Or remove the hard crust before eating

PAGE 5: FLAVOR & SCORING PROBLEMS
________________


PROBLEM #10: WAY TOO SOUR
[No photo needed - this is a taste issue]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING:
      * Bread tastes extremely sour
      * Almost vinegary
      * Too acidic
      * Harsh tang, not pleasant
      * Might even taste alcoholic
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Overfermented
      * Bulk went too long
      * Cold proof went beyond 48 hours
      * Bacteria produced too much acid
Could also be:
Starter was very acidic
      * Hadn't been fed in a while
      * Produced excess acid
High temperature fermentation
      * Warm kitchen (80°F+) favors acid production
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Shorten fermentation times
      * Stop bulk at 50-60% rise instead of 75%
      * Cold proof 12-18 hours instead of 36-48
✓ Use cooler water when mixing
      * Keeps fermentation slower and more controlled
✓ Feed starter regularly
      * Keep it healthy and balanced
      * Don't let it get too acidic
✓ Ferment in cooler spot
      * 68-72°F instead of 75-80°F
      * Slower, less acidic fermentation
________________


PROBLEM #11: NOT SOUR AT ALL
[No photo needed - taste issue]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING:
      * Bread tastes like white bread
      * No tang whatsoever
      * Missing that sourdough flavor
      * Could be from a store
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Underfermented
      * Didn't ferment long enough for acid to develop
      * Rushed through bulk
      * Short cold proof
Could also be:
Very young starter
      * Starter only 1-2 weeks old
      * Hasn't developed complex bacteria culture yet
Too cold during fermentation
      * Very cold kitchen
      * Slow fermentation, less acid production
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Longer fermentation
      * Let bulk go to 75% rise
      * Cold proof 24-36 hours instead of 12-18
✓ Let starter mature
      * Starter gets more complex flavor after 2-3 months
      * Keep feeding it, be patient
✓ Warmer fermentation
      * 72-75°F is good for flavor development
✓ Add small amount of rye
      * 10-15% rye flour adds tang
      * Ferments more actively
________________


PROBLEM #12: SCORING TORE AND BLEW OUT
[LARGE PHOTO: Loaf with jagged, torn score that blew out in random directions]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Score line is ragged and torn
      * Bread burst open in weird places
      * Looks messy and uncontrolled
      * Might have blown out on the sides instead of the score
      * Not a clean, deliberate opening
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Overproofed
      * Final proof went too long
      * Gluten weakened
      * Couldn't contain oven spring
      * Burst randomly
Other causes:
Dull blade
      * Couldn't cut cleanly
      * Dragged and tore instead
Wrong angle
      * Scored straight down (90°) instead of at angle
      * Didn't create a "flap" of dough
Not enough surface tension
      * Poor shaping
      * No tight skin to control where it opens
Scored too shallow
      * Bread found its own weak point to burst through
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Don't overproof
      * Bake from cold (straight from fridge)
      * Or stop room temp proof earlier
      * Slightly underproofed is better for scoring
✓ Use fresh, sharp blade
      * New razor blade or fresh lame
      * Should cut like butter, not drag
✓ Score at 30-45° angle
      * Not straight down
      * Creates a "flap" that opens nicely
✓ Better surface tension during shaping
      * Tight skin helps control where bread opens
✓ Score deep enough
      * ½ inch deep
      * One confident, decisive slash
________________


PROBLEM #13: NO "EAR" ON THE SCORE
[LARGE PHOTO: Loaf with flat score line, no lifted flap/ear]
________________


WHAT YOU'RE SEEING:
      * Score opened but didn't create an "ear" (the lifted ridge)
      * Flat opening instead of dramatic lifted flap
      * Looks okay but not as impressive as you wanted
      * No height to the score
________________


WHAT CAUSED THIS:
Most likely: Wrong scoring angle
      * Scored too vertical (straight down)
      * Need to score at lower angle (30-45°)
Could also be:
Overproofed
      * No energy left for oven spring
      * Can't create lift
Not enough steam
      * Crust set too fast
      * Couldn't expand and lift
Scored too shallow
      * Didn't cut deep enough to create flap
________________


HOW TO FIX IT NEXT TIME:
✓ Score at 30-45° angle
      * This is the key to an ear
      * Blade almost parallel to surface
      * Creates a flap that lifts
✓ Don't overproof
      * Slight underproof actually gives better ear
      * More oven spring energy
✓ Ensure good steam
      * Bake covered first 20 minutes
      * Keeps crust soft so it can lift
✓ Score confidently
      * One smooth, deliberate cut
      * ½ inch deep
      * Don't hesitate

PAGE 6: LEARNING FROM FAILURES
The Path to Better Bread
________________


EVERY "FAILED" LOAF TEACHES YOU SOMETHING
Your first loaf: Will probably have multiple issues. That's normal.
Your third loaf: You'll fix some issues, discover new ones.
Your fifth loaf: You'll start to understand your dough.
Your tenth loaf: You'll have consistent good results.
Your twentieth loaf: You'll be troubleshooting like a pro.
________________


KEEP A BAKING LOG
For each bake, note:
☐ Date and time ☐ Kitchen temperature
☐ Starter feeding time and ratio ☐ Bulk fermentation duration ☐ How dough looked/felt at shaping ☐ Cold proof duration ☐ Final result (photo if possible) ☐ What went well ☐ What to change next time
After 5-10 loaves, patterns will emerge.
You'll notice:
      * "When I ferment for 5 hours, it's always too much"
      * "My kitchen is warmer than I thought"
      * "I need to shape with more tension"
      * "72 hours cold proof is my sweet spot"
This log is gold. Keep it.
________________


THE MOST COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES (IN ORDER)
1. Underfermented bulk (by far #1)
      * Solution: Be patient, watch for 50-75% rise
2. Weak or inactive starter
      * Solution: Feed regularly, use when peaked
3. Poor shaping / no surface tension
      * Solution: Practice, watch videos, drag-and-rotate
4. Underbaked
      * Solution: Go for deep golden brown, internal temp 205°F
5. Not enough flour in banneton
      * Solution: Use WAY more flour, consider rice flour
6. Scoring issues
      * Solution: Sharp blade, 30-45° angle, ½" deep
________________


DON'T CHASE PERFECTION ON LOAF #1
Your goals should be:
Loaf #1-3: Make edible bread, learn the process Loaf #4-6: Improve one thing each time Loaf #7-10: Start getting consistent Loaf #10+: Refine and perfect
Comparison is the thief of joy. Don't compare your loaf #2 to someone's loaf #200 on Instagram.
________________


THE QUESTIONS TO ASK AFTER EACH BAKE
1. Did the dough pass the windowpane test?
      * If no → Work on gluten development next time
2. Did bulk fermentation rise 50-75%?
      * Too little → ferment longer next time
      * Too much → ferment shorter next time
3. Did the poke test show slow spring-back?
      * Too fast → ferment longer
      * No spring → you went too far
4. Was the surface tension tight after shaping?
      * If no → focus on shaping technique
5. Was the oven and Dutch oven fully preheated?
      * If no → give it the full hour next time
6. Did I bake until deep golden brown?
      * If no → bake longer next time
Answer these honestly and you'll improve fast.
________________


WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
A "successful" sourdough loaf:
✓ Has good oven spring (rose up nicely) ✓ Has an open, irregular crumb (holes of various sizes) ✓ Has good crust color (deep golden brown) ✓ Has a crispy crust and tender crumb ✓ Tastes complex with a pleasant tang ✓ You're proud to share it
It doesn't need to:
      * Look like a professional bakery loaf
      * Have giant holes
      * Have a perfect ear
      * Win Instagram
If it tastes good and you learned something, it's a success.

YOUR NEXT STEPS
After a "failed" loaf:
Step 1: Don't throw it away - eat it and enjoy it anyway
Step 2: Find the problem in this troubleshooting guide
Step 3: Write down what to change next time
Step 4: Make another loaf and apply what you learned
Step 5: Repeat until bread is consistently good
This is the path. There are no shortcuts, but it's worth it.
________________


FINAL THOUGHT:
The bread you make at home, even if imperfect, is:
      * Fresher than anything you can buy
      * Made with better ingredients
      * Free of preservatives and additives
      * Made with your own hands
      * A source of pride and satisfaction
Keep going. You've got this.

# SECTION 11: NOTES & TRACKING
**Color: White/blank tab**

## PAGE 1: WHY TRACK YOUR BAKES


### Documentation Leads to Improvement


*Keep notes, spot patterns, get better faster*


---


### WHY BOTHER WRITING IT DOWN?


**Because your memory lies.**


After 5 loaves, you won't remember:
- Which one was bulk for 5 hours vs. 6 hours
- What your kitchen temp was in October vs. December
- Whether the dense loaf was the one with the new flour or the old flour
- How long that perfect loaf cold proofed


**Written records reveal patterns you'd never notice otherwise.**


---


### WHAT YOU'LL DISCOVER BY TRACKING


After logging 10 bakes, you'll know:


✓ **Your kitchen's actual fermentation time**
- Not the recipe's time - YOUR time in YOUR kitchen


✓ **Your ideal cold proof window**
- Maybe 18 hours is your sweet spot
- Or maybe you prefer 36 hours for more sour


✓ **How different flours perform**
- "King Arthur needs 5 hours bulk, Central Milling needs 5.5"


✓ **Seasonal adjustments needed**
- "Summer: use cool water, 4 hour bulk"
- "Winter: use warm water, 7 hour bulk"


✓ **What works and what doesn't**
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships


**This knowledge is gold.** It's personalized to you, your kitchen, your schedule.


---


### HOW TO USE THIS SECTION


**Simple approach:**


1. **Fill out a bake log for each loaf** (Page 2-3)
2. **Take a crumb shot** (cross-section photo)
3. **Note what went well and what to change**
4. **Review logs periodically** to spot patterns
5. **Adjust your process** based on what you learn


**That's it.** You don't need fancy tracking or spreadsheets.


Just consistent notes after each bake.


---


### WHAT TO TRACK (AT MINIMUM)


The essentials:


☐ Date
☐ Kitchen temperature  
☐ Bulk fermentation duration
☐ Cold proof duration
☐ Final result (photo)
☐ One thing that went well
☐ One thing to change next time


**That's 2 minutes of writing per bake.**


Worth it for the improvement you'll see.


---


### TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL TRACKING


✓ **Fill it out right after baking** - while it's fresh


✓ **Be honest** - note failures, don't hide them


✓ **Take photos** - crumb shots are invaluable


✓ **Keep it simple** - don't overthink it


✓ **Review every 5-10 loaves** - look for patterns


✓ **Bring your log to class** - we can troubleshoot together
