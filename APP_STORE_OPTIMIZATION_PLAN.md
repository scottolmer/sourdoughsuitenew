# App Store Optimization (ASO) Plan — Sourdough Suite

**Pricing Model:** Free
**Platforms:** iOS (App Store) & Android (Google Play)

---

## 1. App Name & Subtitle

### iOS App Store

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **App Name** (30 chars max) | `Sourdough Suite: Bread Baking` |
| **Subtitle** (30 chars max) | `Starter, Recipes & Calc Tools` |

### Google Play

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **App Name** (30 chars max) | `Sourdough Suite: Bread Baking` |
| **Short Description** (80 chars max) | `Manage starters, scale recipes, and use 11 pro calculators for sourdough baking` |

**Rationale:** The name leads with the brand ("Sourdough Suite") for recall, then adds the high-volume keyword "Bread Baking." The subtitle/short description targets secondary keywords: starter, recipes, calculators, and tools.

1. German (DE) — strong baking culture
2. French (FR) — artisan bread tradition
3. Spanish (ES) — growing market

## 7. Ratings & Reviews Strategy

### Prompt Timing

Use an in-app review prompt (`StoreKit` on iOS / `In-App Review API` on Android) triggered when the user:

1. Has completed **5+ feeding logs** (indicates active engagement), OR
2. Has used **3+ different calculators**, OR
3. Has opened the app on **7+ distinct days**

**Rules:**
- Never prompt during a bake (i.e., not while a calculator is actively being used)
- Prompt at most once per 90 days
- Do not prompt on first launch

### Review Response Plan

- Respond to every 1–3 star review within 48 hours
- Thank users for positive reviews when they include specific feedback
- Use negative reviews to identify feature requests and bugs

- Ensure free tier retains enough value to maintain ratings

### Seasonal Optimization

  - **Fall/Winter:** Holiday baking, gift-worthy bread
  - **Spring:** New starter season, beginner-friendly messaging
  - **Year-round:** "Bake better bread" is evergreen

### Custom Product Pages (iOS) / Custom Store Listings (Android)

Create variant listings for different audiences:

1. **Beginners** — Lead with Academy + starter tracking, headline: "Start Your Sourdough Journey"
2. **Advanced bakers** — Lead with calculators + baker's percentages, headline: "Pro Tools for Serious Bakers"
3. **Recipe collectors** — Lead with recipe management, headline: "Your Sourdough Recipe Book"
